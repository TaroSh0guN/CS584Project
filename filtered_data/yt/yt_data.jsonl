In the end you have to be the caregiver", "According to HG Tudor, the role of parents is to “protect the child from the vagaries of life, guide him, provide emotional supportnot only, of course, providing him with shelter, warmth, food and drink, but guiding him through life.”", "Most parents, when faced with difficulties, add, “they accept the problem themselves and solve it”since children are not prepared to deal with adult problems.", "However, he says, when it comes to a narcissistic parent, “you as a child may very well become the emotional rock for the narcissist who complains about the behavior of others,” especially a spouse or other family members.", "Additionally, children of narcissistic parents can be expected to perform other tasks, such as housework and caring for their parents, physically or financially.", "In other words, “in the end you have to be the father’s father.”", "2. Boundaries are continually crossed", "Narcissistic parents violate their children’s boundaries, according to HG Tudor, by choosing their friends, prohibiting them from spending time with some people, and generally, interfering in other aspects of their lives.", "Furthermore, he says: “If you try to fight against this interference, it is very possible may you face a wave of fury.”", "3. You are used to validating them", "The third point raised by HG Tudor is that narcissistic parents They use their children to validate them.", "In the video, he says: “They seek your consenteven when you actually don’t agree with their behaviors. They need your approval for this. “They may gossip about other people, criticizing them, hoping you will agree with their position.”", "He adds that they “repeatedly seek validation for their behaviors by receiving your approval; a parent should simply get on with it.”", "“A narcissistic parent may also seek validation by flaunting a child’s accomplishments.” by bragging about them (…) the responses you receive as fuel give you that validation that you are a good, bright and talented parent,” he says.", "Tudor maintains that healthy parents do not seek this validation from external sources.", "4. The use of favorites", "Narcissistic parents use favorites, according to H.G. Tudor, who says it could be one of their children, or one of their cousins, or even their intimate partner, and everyone in between.", "They are “triangulated” with the favorite.", "He adds: “This is noticeable because there are different expectations between you and your peers in terms of school achievements, sporting achievements, where you go in terms of career, what you earn, the positions you hold.", "Favoritism can be demonstrated through punishment.", "For example, For example, they punish you, but never to your brotheror leniency is shown regarding the type of punishment that is applied.", "It is also possible that you are repeatedly triangulated through comparisons, for example, wondering why you can’t be more like the favorite.", "5. Their needs come before yours", "Sharing his fifth point, HG Tudor says that the narcissistic parent’s free time is more important than being a parent, which can result in neglect, as they are “too absorbed” in what they are doing to be interested in what their offspring have to say.", "He suggests that one can go further, saying: “They may create a false crisis (…) to force you to attend to what they require, disturbing your daily life. They may find that they repeatedly ask you for help when they could manage perfectly well on their own, or that they demand that help with certain problems, resulting in your life being disrupted.”", "6. Blame others", "The narcissistic parent is never able to take responsibility, according to the content creator, who adds that blaming others is “part of the defense mechanism of narcissism.”", "Giving examples of some of the things parents can say, HG Tudor said: “If I hadn’t had you, I’d be a multi-millionaire by now. Look what you did to me. Did you make me like that? You made me hit you. you ruined my life. Everything was wonderful until you arrived.”", "7. Your independence is a threat to the narcissist", "According to HG Tudor, although a healthy father will naturally be “when your child finally flies the nest”, is aware that “it’s all part of the healthy evolution of the relationship” and knows that it is healthy for the child to make his or her own path in the world.", "However, this is not the case when it comes to the narcissistic parent, he says.", "“As the son of a narcissistic father (…) you must be controlled“he explains.", "He adds: “Anything that, as you become more independent, frees you from the shackles of that narcissist’s control, will threaten that narcissist’s need for control, resulting in the need to try to nullify that threat of control somehow”.", "8. The narcissist lives through you", "Moving on to the eighth point, HG Tudor says: “You are simply an extension of the narcissistic parenta small mirror that is there to do what the narcissist wants, to always be under control.”", "The result of this, he says, is that “your character traits are taken over by the narcissist and your individuality is diminished.”", "Additionally, the narcissistic parent may dictate important life decisions, such as what to do professionally, and stealing credit for your achievements.", "He adds: “Control of your achievements is also a way to assert control over yourselfto remind you that you are there only by the grace of the narcissist.", "9. You will be marginalized so that the narcissist remains superior", "According to the content creator, “the narcissist can empower himself or weaken other people.”", "And he adds: “And that is why, as the son of a narcissist, you will constantly feel belittled. This is reflected in nit-picking criticism, rejection of your own successes, diminishment of your achievements (…) No matter how hard you try, no matter what you achieve, you end up being marginalized.”", "10. You are often embarrassed", "The narcissist has no emotional empathy for you, HG Tudor says in the video, noting that “your reactions, your emotional responses to circumstances They are simply discarded“.", "He adds that when his child cries, they may ask him to stop and accuse him of overreact.", "“His lack of emotional empathy is clear and evident,” he stated.", "“They are not interested in helping you.

{"title": "Mind Reading: Michael D. Ratner’s Lens On Mental Health Storytelling In Pop Culture", "body": ["Demi Lovato presented Michael D. Ratner with the Project Healthy Minds Storyteller of the Year award ... [+] at the PHM Gala in October 2024 Clint Spaulding", "Back in February 2020, the Justin Bieber docuseries Seasons debuted on YouTube.", "The 10-part series dove deep into the mental stress and addiction struggles of one of the biggest stars on the planet.", "It also broke the record for the most-viewed premiere in its first week over all YouTube Originals, with nearly 33 million views, and has accumulated north of 430 million views to date.", "It was a watershed moment not only for Bieber and YouTube, but also for the purveyor of project, OBB Media founder Michael D. Ratner, whose love of media dates back to his Hebrew school days.", "“When I created something funny, there was no greater feeling I had than knowing what I did worked. I loved the response to it,” he says.", "As his dream of launching a content studio became reality, Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree Ratner says he realized the power he had not only to entertain, but to help.", "“I started to see a recurring theme in many of the projects I was working with talent and celebrities, that they were being really open about their mental health,” he says.", "“I started thinking, could I create stories that would make people feel less alone and talk about mental health. It’s something many people are experiencing, and it’s something a new generation was beginning to get more comfortable talking about. I thought, we could not only make compelling content, we could actually do our small part and affect how people feel.”", "As he began to grasp the volume of people watching Seasons, Ratner says, “that’s when I was like, Oh, this really does make a difference and it really is helping people and having that compound effect of, if you can result in one more person opening up and feeling less alone and they pass that along, you can really put a dent in this thing.", "“I think prior to Seasons—and I’m not saying we pioneered it, but I think we helped—many mental health stories were told as retrospectives, when somebody is older and they’re retired and out of their prime. There was something very special about Justin in his mid 20s, in the height of his potential and his proximity to young people, being so willing to be so open and vulnerable. It’s much easier to relate to someone who’s closer in age, even if they’re a huge global superstar, and that was a great differentiator,” he says.", "“You have more to lose, telling it in your prime. If the stigma wins out, then people are like, ‘This person is messed up’ and it starts making you lose fans. Of course mental health shouldn’t have a negative stigma, but that connotation has existed and the willingness to put that aside and trust that people are still going to look at you in an inspirational, aspirational way, want to buy your music, listen to you… it’s really empowering.”", "Since then, Ratner’s passion for mental health storytelling has grown, as have his aligned projects.", "Among them: 2021 docuseries Dancing With the Devil, in which Demi Lovato gets strikingly candid about her near-fatal overdose; and Kids Are Growing Up, his 2024 doc with The Kid Laroi that traverses the music artist’s coming into adulthood while navigating fame, his mental state, his first love, and the death of his mentor, Juice WRLD.", "Ratner is also a co-producer on Lovato’s current Hulu documentary Child Star.", "He’s quick to credit the subjects who trust him to shepherd their stories, noting, “They deserve the applause. I’m here to help them see through their vision and create the construct to feel comfortable, but it’s them who are taking that leap to be willing to put the good, the bad and the ugly on screen.”", "But there’s clearly both an art and a science Ratner continues to refine that enables him to foster an environment where some of the biggest names in popular culture are at ease opening up.", "“They aren’t educational videos, they aren’t tutorials… this is deeply embedded mental health storytelling within larger projects that people want to see because they enjoy seeing their favorite artists. And that, infiltrating the mainstream, is chipping away at” the stigma both within the industry and the mainstream, he says.", "Ratner acknowledges “there is a lot of groundwork that goes on behind the scenes in building trust; these aren’t quick-turn projects. There’s no questioning motive. We are absolutely trying to put this on the screen for an audience. But it’s about, ‘Can we connect on a deeper level.’ It’s really giving somebody a safe place to talk about what they’ve gone through and try to understand and accept the imperfect nature of every person. If someone’s willing to tell you their deep dark secrets and you’re not standing there judging them, I think that makes them feel comfortable. I’m not there to judge.”", "And while there’s no one secret sauce, Ratner does have a line—albeit one that’s hard to quantify.", "“Where is that line of telling a great objective story and then where is the line of being salacious and click bait-y and trying to expose something for virality,” he says.", "“I can’t give you a perfect answer of how I identify that line, but I trust my gut. I care about my relationships with people but I also care about my work and I find that line and I stick to it,” he says.", "“There’s commercial, there’s the truth, there’s objectivity, there’s subjectivity… none of this is clean buckets. And I partner with the talent frequently, that’s why a line from the get-go is crucial. There’s a big difference between somebody saying, There’s nothing I’m not willing to speak about, and as a director you receive that information and that’s music to your ears, but that’s not free license to go and just beat something to death that’s unnecessary or over-include or manipulate a certain way. That’s where I think you lose trust.”", "In recognition of his work destigmatizing mental health in pop culture, Ratner was honored by Project Healthy Minds with the mental health org’s Storyteller of the Year award at the PHM Gala in October.", "Lovato was there to present the accolade.", "“It was very meaningful having Demi present because of how much we’ve done together,” he says.", "“I was receiving the honor, but it was on behalf of these artists. This isn’t me being humble. I firmly believe, Yes, I create a comfortable environment and I’m able to create a construct through which people and tell their stories. But they are the ones putting themselves front and center. It’s not like the camera is on me.”", "As for his own self-care, it’s a work in progress, evidenced by the chuckle the question immediately elicits.", "“I’m working on that,” Ratner says.", "“It’s a grind to build a company and then you blink and what you dreamed of happens, if you’re so lucky.", "And you need to learn put up boundaries at that point because what got you here won’t get you there.", "You need to learn to say no.", "You can’t take every meeting, you can’t take every project.", "You need to get some rest.", "“And I think that the ability of accepting the fact that you can’t be everywhere, you can’t do the FOMO thing, whether it’s personally or professionally, and trying to figure out what to you is enough. I’m describing things I haven’t mastered yet but I think the first step is knowing you need to get there.”", "Mind Reading (formerly Hollywood & Mind) is a recurring column that features interviews with musicians, actors, athletes, creators and other culture influencers who are elevating conversation and action around mental health, and breaking stigma."], "provider": {"name": "Forbes", "domain": "forbes.com"}, "publication_date": "2024-11-14T22:20:21+00:00", "label": 1}

Maybe all the stress and everything really isn’t all that great for you.”", "And that hadn’t been, until about nine years ago, an area of study for me, but then I began to engage in that area just to try and find that out.", "And what I initially found out is, well, we don’t have a lot on Latter-day Saints, but the general research on religion and mental health suggested that those who are engaged in religion have better mental health.", "And this is actually something that we’ve been doing research on for quite some time, even back to 120 years ago, with Émile Durkheim.", "He looked at, well, how do different religious denominations differ in their suicide rates for what he was looking at, and supposed that, “Well, maybe theology and different practices relate to mental health differently for these groups.”", "And so we’ve been looking at this for a long time.", "And in fact, the last few decades, we’ve accumulated a lot of research on this.", "The research in general has suggested that the more religious a person is, the better their mental health is.", "And so me doing this research on temple attendance and Latter-day Saints, in one way, isn’t particularly surprising, because it fits really well within this very well-established body of research on religion and mental health.", "But what we haven’t done before is look at, “All right, let’s look at the particulars of temple attendance and see how that relates to mental health.”", "A note on just Latter-day Saints in general, it’s found that in general, Latter-day Saints seem to have better mental health, and within the overall research on mental health and religion, that’s not particularly surprising, because Latter-day Saints tend to be really religious people, and so them being more religious, it’s not surprising that in general, you would see Latter-day Saints having better mental health.", "So that’s just kind of the overall research on religion and mental health.", "And then it’s been really nice in particular to look at Latter-day Saints and delve into adolescents as they develop and how do the various aspects of their religious lives connect with their mental health.", "5:21", "Mary Richards: Yeah.", "I think so many parents, like myself — I have three teenagers — and youth leaders and bishops and so many are going to be so interested by this research, because of course we want to feel like our efforts are doing something, are bearing fruit, you know, and our efforts to have family prayer, to read scriptures with our children, to go ahead and set up appointments for them at the temple and get them there.", "Even this last Wednesday, I had the alarm set for 6 a.m. and went and woke up my 13-year-old, and he was thinking, “Why am I doing this right now? Why am I going to the temple? It’s 6 in the morning. I could be sleeping.”", "And I could have said, “Oh, you’re right, you need sleep.”", "But no, I was like, “We’re going to the temple. It’s good for us. It’s good for you.”", "And he had a great experience, and I was grateful for that.", "If we could look at these numbers, I guess, because me thinking I can then go back to my teenagers and show, “Here’s the proof that it’s going to help you. That’s why I’m waking you up at 6 a.m.”", "Tell us a little bit about what you saw and who you studied.", "These were Utah and Arizona youth in particular, right?", "6:22", "Justin Dyer: That’s right, yeah.", "So for this round, we wanted to get a good representative sample of Latter-day Saints.", "Nationally, that’s a little bit hard to do because we’re such low proportion of the population to other locations.", "So for this first round of data collection and looking into Latter-day Saints, which shows areas that are a little higher concentration of Latter-day Saints, so that we could get a good portion of them.", "Let me go a little bit technical now, if you don’t mind, into this, and you can decide how much to put in.", "We wanted to get a really good random sample of individuals, so we worked with a national research firm that collects publicly available data, has information on over 80 million households in the United States.", "And so we asked them for a random sample of those within the areas we were interested in.", "So we got a random sample of households, and we also specified, “Hey, we want kids between the ages of 12 and 14.”", "Now, this is back in 2016 that we started this.", "And so we got that random sample of households with kids those ages, and we sent them all letters, and we gave them a call.", "And we didn’t allow for, say, snowball sampling, where they could invite their friends or family to participate.", "We didn’t want that, because that decreases the randomness of it and makes the sample a little more similar.", "They could only participate if they were randomly chosen.", "So we really wanted to get as good a sample as we possibly could.", "That takes a little bit of effort, but BYU students, shout out to them.", "They’re amazing, and they really did the lion’s share of the work to get this really nice sample for us.", "So yes, we’re in Utah and Arizona, and then with that sample of just over 1,000 kids — a little over half Latter-day Saints, the other half other religions, because we really wanted that comparison group.", "And so then since 2016, every other year, we’ve interviewed these kids.", "And so now, you know, 12 to 14 in the research report that we’re looking at here, those data went to 2022.", "We actually just barely finished the 2024 collection, and I’m very excited to dig into that.", "But what’s key in this is that we’re able to look at how people change over time.", "In order to determine whether one thing causes another, well, you really do need an experimental design and all that.", "We can’t do that because you can’t randomly assign people to be Latter-day Saints or randomly assign a person to, you know, go to the temple, you don’t go to the temple for a year, you know.", "And so the best thing that we can do with this kind of observational behavioral research is simply track them over time and see how one thing influences change in another thing.", "We can’t ultimately determine causality, but this is about as close as we can get, and what we find really fits within the overall research, the most rigorous research on religion and mental health.", "So, that’s kind of the outline of how we approached this research, is to see: How do these kids develop over time?", "What is it in their family life, in their religion, that impacts their mental health?", "And how does their mental health impact their family and religion?", "9:16", "Mary Richards: Yeah.", "And so looking at them starting when they’re 12 and then moving forward, talk about some of the things you saw as they grew older.", "If they were attending the temple more regularly when they were younger, weren’t they more likely to continue attending and then even be endowed when they were 18?", "9:31", "Justin Dyer: Yes, absolutely.", "Temple attendance had a very strong association; if they’re doing that early on, they’re more likely to stay a member of the Church, they’re more likely to attend church, they’re more likely to be endowed.", "And in fact, what we found is that if you were attending the temple earlier on, and looking four years, projecting four years, in the future, those that were not attending at all, 33% of them disaffiliated from the Church four years later.", "And so we saw a drop-off of those who weren’t attending.", "However, if you were attending at least monthly, it’s 12% of those that disaffiliated four years later.", "Still, you know, we wish we could keep everybody, but there seemed to be a real relationship between temple attendance and staying a member of the Church.", "10:23", "Mary Richards: You want to worship more because you believe, and your belief is strengthened as you worship?", "Back and forth?", "Justin Dyer: Yeah, absolutely.", "In fact, that’s one of the things that we found, is we tried to understand, “Well, what is it about temple attendance that impacts whether or not they stayed in the Church?”", "And one of those things seemed to be Restoration beliefs; beliefs in the Book of Mormon, in modern-day prophets.", "And actually, as I found that in these data, it reminded me of when I was a teenager myself, and I was sitting in the baptistry, and I picked up a Book of Mormon, you know, that are just sitting there, and I was looking around at the holy work that was being done.", "I was sitting in this beautiful, peaceful place.", "I was feeling the Spirit of the Lord.", "And I thought, “This is one of the fruits of the Restoration,” you know, thinking about Joseph Smith, this is one of the fruits.", "And that, for me as a teenager, actually really helped me.", "And I think the temple does particularly help with, say, beliefs about the Restoration, because it’s very unique to the Restoration.", "Nobody else in other religions are doing baptisms for the dead as we do, and so them having that kind of unique experience with a Restoration practice and Restoration doctrine seems to — from the research and from my own experience — really helps to connect us with the Restoration, with the Church, and helps us to stick in there.", "11:53", "Mary Richards: Yeah.", "That belief that the gospel was restored; that Joseph Smith and then prophets since have been commanded to build temples; that we should attend; that President Russell M. Nelson, our President and Prophet today, emphasizes the temple so beautifully with such invitations, really.", "I could say urging, but invitations for us to worship, to attend more often.", "And when you feel connected to that, there’s that connection to the temple and desire to go more, or that kind of back-and-forth relationship, I guess.", "12:23", "Justin Dyer: Yeah, absolutely.", "I think that’s so well said.", "And with the overall research on religion and mental health, we — very sadly in our day — we have a crisis of mental health, rates of depression, anxiety, other things are increasing.", "And part of that certainly could be that we are better at diagnosing these things today.", "But it does seem to be the case that we are struggling more, particularly because suicide is increasing so substantially In the world today.", "And the loss of religion is very likely playing a role in that.", "We’ve decreased substantially in religiosity in society, while at the same time, mental health problems, suicide rates have greatly increased.", "In fact, Harvard researcher Tyler VanderWeele has estimated that nearly 40% of the increase in the suicide rate could be attributed to the decrease of church attendance.", "And so when we see this temple attendance, perhaps when we see the research suggesting, at least, that temple attendance may be key in helping keep people connected to church, the emphasis that the leaders of the Church are putting on the temple nowadays is, on so many levels, such a beautiful, beautiful thing.", "But as we’re talking about religion and mental health and temple attendance and mental health and all these things, what can happen, and what we social scientists tend to do, is be what we call reductive, and we reduce something down to just kind of this component parts.", "And that’s very useful.", "And I think in this conversation, we could find that, “Oh, there’s some utility in that.”", "But what can happen is we can be so reductive is that we lose the overall purpose.", "The purpose of being in the temple is to help to build eternal families and to gather Israel on both sides of the veil and to worship the Lord.", "That is so critical that we remember that in all of these details, we don’t get that overall purpose of the temple lost.", "14:37", "Some people might hear this and say, “Oh, OK, well, I just need to go to the temple more, and my major depressive disorder is going to go away, and I’m going to be cured of, you know, whatever it is.”", "And we’ve got to be very cautious about that.", "What we’re finding is, “Hey, there are some wonderful things that may be an outcome of temple attendance, but it’s certainly not going to be the outcome for every single person.", "Sometimes it’s like thinking about exercise.", "Exercise is really good for mental health, but if somebody says, “I’m going to exercise, and my depression is going to disappear,” certainly exercising will be a good thing for that individual, on a lot of levels, but not necessarily it’s going to automatically make the depression disappear.", "Certainly a good thing to do, and, for most people, that is an effect, is to improve your mental health.", "But there are some people for whom that might not be the effect.", "Other people might struggle with certain aspects of perfectionism, or some people may experience obsessive-compulsive disorder — or the religious manifestation of that, scrupulosity — and they might hear this and say, “Oh, OK, I just have to go to the temple more.”", "And they might obsessively do that in a way to cure whatever difficulties that they’re experiencing.", "Now, again, if, go again to the example of exercise, somebody with obsessive-compulsive disorder might exercise obsessively.", "Now, again, exercise is a good thing, but if we do it as part of some other difficulties that we might be experiencing and thinking that it’s going to have a particular effect, we’ll probably be disappointed in that.", "And so for most people that hear this and say, “Oh, going to the temple more could be good for my mental health,” for the most part, as what the research shows, that’s probably going to be the case.", "However, we do have to recognize individual differences within this, that not everybody is going to be affected in the same way.", "And even if we go to the temple and we don’t find the kind of mental health improvements, well, there’s larger purposes for going to the temple that we accomplish.", "16:45", "Mary Richards: Well, you know, I’m reading right from your research paper, and this is exactly what you were talking about here.", "You write that “the correlation between depression and temple attendance was significant and remained somewhat steady across time.”", "In other words, greater temple attendance was related to lower depression.", "And you talk about, though, that brush and correlation doesn’t take in personal experiences, which you were talking about.", "But I love that a few paragraphs later, and throughout your research paper, you quote President Russell M. Nelson and his teachings on the temple.", "He said in April 2024 general conference, “The temple is the gateway to the greatest blessings God has in store for each of us,” and he encouraged Latter-day Saints to worship in the temple “as regularly as your circumstances permit,” because it is because of this greater purpose of being in the temple, right?", "Gathering Israel, worshipping, connecting with the Savior, having that covenant connection.", "President Nelson said, “Nothing will help you more to hold fast to the iron rod than worshipping in the temple as regularly as your circumstances permit.”", "And so that covenant connection with the Savior and with our Heavenly Father, because the Savior is the Master Healer, right?", "17:53", "Justin Dyer: Oh, absolutely.", "And I love how President Nelson puts that — it’s the gateway, right?", "It’s going to facilitate our connecting with the Savior, with us making covenants with the Savior.", "It’s not the end, right?", "Going through the doors of the temple, sometimes they say, right, “We need to go to the temple. We need to have the temple go into us and through us.”", "And so if we do it just to check the box in terms of, “Oh, I went to the temple,” that’s probably not going to be very effective.", "If we’re going to the temple and we’re seeking the healing of the Savior, and we’re seeking Him, and we’re seeking to serve Him, there’s service.", "Getting outside of oneself is a wonderful help to our mental health.", "Again, it’s a byproduct, right?", "We don’t serve people because, “All right, I’m trying to, you know, improve my mental health by doing some service,” but that’s a wonderful byproduct, often, is because we begin to see a broader perspective.", "Some mental health difficulties, our minds just narrow in on a single thing that we focus on, when we can step back, expand our view, get a view of the whole plan of salvation and the role of the Savior in that, that can be incredibly, incredibly helpful.", "Again, none of this — I don’t want to, again, say that, automatically, your obsessive-compulsive disorder, your depression, is going to disappear — but certainly as part of a process in your life, and being able to step back and serve other people, that is a beautiful, beautiful thing and helps us to walk the pathway of healing.", "It might not be the healing exactly the moment I, you know, stepped in the temple, but that can be the pathway that I’m taking on that healing journey as I’m serving others, uniting families, gathering Israel on both sides of the veil and letting the people in the temple serve you along with that.", "That’s one of the reasons why religion, we find, is so good for people, is those connections with other individuals, that reaching out and being reached out to is something that’s so critical in religion, and it’s part of what Alma says at the Waters of Mormon, where he talks about bearing one another’s burdens.", "“Oh, you want to come into the fold of Christ? Well, we need to bear one another’s burdens that they may be light. We need to mourn with those that mourn and comfort those that stand in need of comfort.”", "The Lord so wants us to be able to participate in this process of bearing one another’s burdens, and in the temple is a location where that can happen at a very personal, really special level.", "20:53", "Mary Richards: Let’s talk about what your research shows about getting teenagers to the temple.", "As a parent, so I have a missionary who’s 19 and a 16-year-old, a 13-year-old, and then our fourth son will be turning 12 next year, and so in the early months of next year, we hope to start his temple worship and attendance and doing baptisms and such.", "What were some of the things that you found that then families can do that strengthens and supports temple attendance?", "21:19", "Justin Dyer: Well, we wish we had everything on what families were doing, but we have a few things, and they can give us some kind of indicator on what those things might be.", "So, for example, family prayer was huge in terms of predicting the youth’s temple attendance, particularly early on, right?", "That 12, 13, 14, 15, family prayer was very predictive.", "Now, that’s probably because it’s associated with families who do stuff together, right?", "Families who are engaged with religion together.", "So that’s probably that indicator there.", "But the family prayer, in terms of an effect, kind of fade as you go along.", "And so, if we’re doing those things early — because kids, 12, 13, I have teens, I have a 19-year-old, a 17-year-old, a 14-year-old.", "Mary Richards: We line up pretty well.", "You’re in the thick of it, just like me.", "22:15", "Justin Dyer: Twelve-year-old, 10-year-old and 8-year-old, right?", "So, I’ve got all these kids, and my younger kids, they can’t get to the temple by themselves.", "I mean, that’s just not possible.", "And so us taking them and us building in family patterns of religious practices, then, helps them to start going to the temple and start saying, “Oh, this is something that we as a family do. We’re religious together.”", "And then that can help to jump-start and push them forward in the future.", "Something I’d also say is that we didn’t have this, we weren’t able to look at it, is family scripture study.", "Kids who study their scriptures, particularly later — so in the 16, 17, 18 range — if they’re studying their scriptures, they’re more likely to increase in their temple attendance through that time period.", "So, personal scripture study doesn’t predict it really well at the younger ages — that’s where family makes most of the difference — but if the family can help to instill that scripture study, that scripture study then seems to make an impact later on.", "And so those kinds of things that we’re doing in the early years, I think, seem to be really critical in terms of family religious activities together, be it family prayer, family scripture study, encouraging scripture study.", "Scripture study tended to be one of the things that was very predictive of being endowed later on.", "So, and I don’t want to have any parents feel like, “Oh, I missed my window, and, you know, I can’t affect them anymore,” and those kinds of things.", "Mary Richards: Or “I have done all these things. Why aren’t we seeing, you know, that sort of thing?”", "23:49", "Justin Dyer: Exactly.", "Exactly. So none of these is a silver bullet, of course, right?", "And yet, what it does is it provides the very best ground for the seed to flourish.", "A lot of what we’re doing in parenting is simply preparing the ground.", "And we can say, you know, “We prepared the ground as well as our mortal, fallen parenthood can.”", "And all of us feel that and have experienced that.", "We prepared the ground as very best that we can.", "And that’s what really this is about.", "How do we prepare that ground?", "How do we, you know, Jacob 5, you know, give it nutrients and work that ground so that it gives it the very best chance to thrive.", "Even the Lord of the vineyard, some of the trees were a bit wild.", "Some of our kids are a bit wild.", "But what we can do is, in all that, is prepare the ground as very best we can.", "And then with our older kids, if they’re not connected with the Church, we still prepare that ground by helping them feel the Lord’s love through us.", "24:53", "Mary Richards: You know, and as Sister Tamara W. Runia taught so beautifully in general conference, of the Young Women general presidency, we “stay at the tree.”", "We continue to keep our covenants, we partake of God’s love, we continue to keep those relationships strong.", "That’s something I think about.", "I also thought about here, too, that yes, your research — because you needed a good-sized sample, and so you’re looking at Utah and Arizona, where temples are a little closer to the people.", "Now, because of this just incredible growth of temple building around the world, temples are getting closer to people.", "How can we help families of teenagers in some of these places where it’s harder to get to a temple, a house of the Lord, right now?", "25:32", "Justin Dyer: Oh, that’s such a great question.", "And so I’m sure there’s some people who are listening and saying, Well, I’d love to attend the temple more, but, you know, it’s just not possible.", "We may be able to get a youth group together.", "”", "25:43", "Mary Richards: That was me growing up in the Midwest.", "It was maybe once a year, we’d do a big temple trip, take a big bus.", "But the temples are coming closer, at least in the Midwest, to my family now.", "But I’m sorry to interrupt you, but yes, that idea of around the world, of, would you say, you know, continue this idea that you are a temple-recommend-holding family, or that you are a temple-worthy family, those kinds of things.", "26:05", "Justin Dyer: Oh, absolutely.", "And that’s why I love how President Nelson talked about, as often “as your circumstances permit.”", "Going to the temple is a sacrifice.", "For me, I have several temples around me, and so it’s a little bit smaller sacrifice.", "But OK, if I’m a regular going, that does require a little bit more of me.", "And that requirement is actually a good thing, right?", "That we invest.", "For people who are farther from the temple and can’t get there as regularly, them going as often as they can is still that investment, is still giving something to the Lord, is still focused on what the temple means and why we go there.", "I suppose the farthest I’ve ever lived from a temple is about three hours from the temple, and I wasn’t going nearly as often as I do now, but that preparation and the thought that goes into that, and the specialness, then, with my little kids — I had little kids at the time.", "They were, you know, not old enough to do baptisms or anything — but it was a, “OK, we’re going to take our family down, and my wife and I are going to switch off attending the temple.”", "And our kids ran around in that area.", "And so in some ways, even though it was less frequent, because of the sacrifice involved and the planning and all that, it did do something for us, maybe that the kind of temple attendance that I have now doesn’t quite do, but perhaps the frequency, if you will, now, may make up for that in some way.", "And so the answer with so many of these things is simply: We do the very best that we can, but certainly those family religious practices, right?", "Even if we can’t be in the temple, those family religious practices are crucial to this.", "Now, having six children, family religious practices aren’t always going to go the way we want them to.", "Mary Richards: He’s breathing my air.", "28:16", "Justin Dyer: You know, the wrestling matches that we’ve just had to, you know, it’s not wrestling the scriptures.", "That would be a little bit better, I suppose, it’s their wrestling each other during that.", "But the patterns that we lay down and the importance that our children see that we place on these things, even in the less-than-ideal circumstances that our family religious practices might take, it still matters, and the Lord sees that.", "28:43", "Mary Richards: Yeah.", "As we wrap up, are there any resources you’d like to point people to when we talk more about this conversation of religiosity and mental health, about temple attendance and our teenagers in particular, where would you point people to go to learn some more information?", "28:56", "Justin Dyer: So, obviously the Church has their Life Help section, and they have the Mental Health section there.", "That’s a wonderful place to go to get some information about that.", "For those individuals who might be struggling with scrupulosity, there’s a wonderful book by Debra Debra McClendon called “Freedom From Scrupulosity: Reclaiming Your Religious Experience From Anxiety and OCD.”", "It’s a wonderful resource by a fantastic mental health professional that is specifically focusing on Latter-day Saints.", "So, that’s a very good resource to look at as well.", "29:30", "Mary Richards: Yeah, the Life Help section you mentioned is in Gospel Library.", "It’s incredible.", "There’s so much to find there.", "And also, I would point people to the Emotional Resilience course offered by Welfare and Self-Reliance Services.", "I took that course and learned so much about how to be better myself at building more self-reliance, building more emotional resilience to the things in my life and around me.", "29:51", "Justin Dyer: Another thing is to make sure that we are having open communication with our loved ones.", "We might not know that we’re experiencing what might be OCD or some other anxiety or depression.", "And so if we’re having those kinds of conversations as parents to children, that’s going to be very helpful to be able to understand more of what their experiences are.", "30:13", "Mary Richards: So, there’s so much out there.", "And of course, we’ve also been mentioning President Nelson’s teachings and invitations, and I go back to what he told youth and young adults about your most important identities, that you are a child of God and that you are a child of the covenant, and you are a disciple of Jesus Christ.", "And isn’t that what we do, why we go to worship in the house of the Lord, is because of those that identity, I would think, as well, at least, that’s what I’m finding in my own life as I learn and grow and muddle through being a parent of teenagers and my own journey.", "We have a question we ask every Church News podcast guest, and that is: What do you know now?", "And so, I would love to ask you, Professor Justin Dyer, what do you know now, after these many years that you’ve studied this intersection and correlation and relationship between religiosity and mental health, but what do you know now as well about teenagers and the house of the Lord?", "31:11", "Justin Dyer: I think one of the things that I’ve learned is how much the Lord truly loves us and how much He is trying to help us through His gospel, through the organization of the Church, through the temple, and how wonderfully blessed these children of ours are because they have it.", "Now, are there difficulties?", "Absolutely.", "Do we experience hard things sometimes in the Church?", "Do we feel weight put upon us?", "Sometimes in the

for relief all the time.", "It's something you think about all the time in local office.", "You know, property taxes are too high.", "Do I really want to raise them to be able to do this?", "But we have to do this.", "So, those are the struggles you deal with.", "It's something I have lived with for so long.", "It's still part of who I am as governor, which says to me, I want to support them directly.", "If they need $2 million, you're going to get $2 million.", "And this fire department is a model for all that is possible.", "You know, it's — I like to think of New Yorkers as being rather exceptional.", "A little biased here, but it's that resiliency, and the leadership skills and the dedication and the grit that we all have here in the State of New York.", "And so put that to

neighboring communities.", "And that is something that we're just so, so known for here on Long Island.", "So, there's so many things that we want to take care of, but I also want to let you know that

We cannot put down the phones, we cannot break the addiction.”", "And I have to do something.", "I'm the first woman governor, but also I'm the first mom governor whose kids have gone through this, and I see so many family members and so, I applaud you.", "And also Project Healthy Mind for putting a spotlight on something that four or five years ago I don't think there would have been as much interest in, but now even the Surgeon General has declared this a crisis.", "And we, in leadership positions, have no option but to act, and I've been doing this for years.", "Linsey Davis, ABC News: And when you talk about the stress, anxiety, uncertainty in particular that kids are feeling — give us an idea of some of the initiatives, some of the specific steps that your administration is taking.", "Governor Hochul: Well, number one, when I first became governor three years ago, I knew that there's still a stigma about seeking help.", "I mean, I've been working on this in the addictive space — opioid addiction — and so people don't want to get help.", "Mental health, it seems like you're admitting a weakness if you seek help.", "I'm glad to see there's been an evolution where more people are open about it and talking about it on social media platforms and podcasts, and programs like this that allow people to feel more comfortable with the fact that we're all imperfect.", "Sometimes we need help at different points in our lives.", "But when it came down to what I could do as governor — $1 billion I put on the table.", "I said, “This means we're serious.”", "The whole array of services, whether it's in schools — which I think is one of the most important places [for there to be] mental health services and clinics inside our schools — to help kids who are starting to show signs of fraying from the stress.", "If we help them now, we don't have to commit them to a lifetime of needing services and help later.", "So, it's right in the classroom, all the way to dealing with the challenge of homelessness and mental health challenges on our subways — we have embedded teams that are professionals, they're caring, I've met with them so many times, I've been there with them — they meet individuals who others may walk by and be afraid of and say, “You know, that person could do harm to myself or my baby in the stroller. I'm a senior citizen going to a doctor's appointment.”", "There's a fear that's embedded in all of us when you see something that is unknown to you.", "So, let's get people help.", "They do not deserve to live on the subways and in our streets; we get them supportive housing so there's money involved in that as well; opening up more mental health beds.", "During the pandemic — people don't know this — thousands of beds dedicated for providing mental health services in our hospitals were converted to COVID beds.", "And then afterward I said, “Well, why aren't they all back online? I'm tracking the numbers. Why do we have such a shortage in places like New York City? Why is there a shortage of hospital beds available to treat people who need these services?”", "Well, it turns out that the reimbursement rates were higher for a hospital, more profit could be made if you kept them as non-psychiatric beds because those costs are higher.", "So I said, “That's not okay.”", "I closed the gap so they can make the money they need to make on Medicaid provided beds, so that was taken care of.", "And also making those — bringing them back online.", "So it's everything from the classroom to reducing the stigma in countless ways, programs like this, money for programming and supportive services.", "Everything we can think of, we're trying to do.", "But my job is to make sure we don't start another whole generation of young people who are held captive to these algorithms.", "We have nation leading legislation, and I'll tell you, taking on the tech companies is not the easiest thing in life to do, but we forced them to adhere to what we're saying in New York.", "In New York State, as a result of laws that I enacted just a few months ago and with the support of Common Sense Media and other great organizations and our advocates, no longer can social media companies unsolicited — and bombard young people with addictive algorithms without them asking for it.", "Their parents have to be okay with that.", "I don't think too many parents are going to say that's okay.", "They also cannot send notifications all night long to our kids who need a good night's sleep.", "They're exhausted.", "You don't function at a high level as an adult, but certainly not a young person supposed to sit for eight hours a day and be paying attention when you haven't slept at night because you cannot put down that addictive feature, which is your phone.", "And so that's where we are now, and again, talking about what's happening in schools.", "Stood up to the social media companies.", "We are a tech society.", "We are a tech state.", "We're a tech city.", "I welcome the tech companies.", "This is not an ‘us against them,’ it is saying, “You know better. You are all executives who probably have children.

I'm in competition with this cell phone, and they're not looking at me, they're not paying attention. I'm trying to create a bond and a relationship with them. And I, by the end of this school year, I've thrown in the towel, I can't do this anymore.”", "So the teachers want it.", "School districts want me to be the heavy.", "I said, “I get blamed for everything anyhow, just add it to the list, right?”", "It's like, \"I can take it, don't worry about me.", "” So I said, “I'll be the heavy because this is right.”", "The parents are the ones you worry about, right?", "And I'm a mom.", "My kids were in middle school during Columbine.", "So that shapes how you feel, that insecurity when the most, you know, your most precious person in the world to you is your child going off to kindergarten.", "And again, I still sometimes think about how I cried for days when my kid's going off to kindergarten.", "Then they go off to college, it's like, bye, give us a call once in a while.", "So, but, it's hard.", "And when you see this — the shootings, the mass shootings, we did an event with Gabby Giffords yesterday on gun violence, and thank you for raising that.", "We have the toughest gun laws in the country, by the way, and the lowest — third lowest homicide rate by the — third lowest in the nation.", "So that's another focus, but it ties into anxiety that parents have and they feel now that because they have to be connected with their kids all day long and, and especially if there's a crisis on the school grounds.", "There's the worst nightmare of all: a school shooter on the loose near your child.", "I also was thinking, well, maybe this is going be too hard for parents because, you know, it's a lot to ask and they're going to be worried.", "When I talk to law enforcement, and they said to me, “Tell the parents and we'll tell them — if there is an active shooter on the grounds, in the building — the last thing you want your child to be doing is looking for their cell phone, starting to record things, talking to their friends, calling their parents.”", "He said, “They need to be focused on the adult in the room who will lead them to safety.”", "And that was my aha moment.", "I said, “You're right. Parents need to know that.”", "So, there's that safety issue, but also, my kids are adults now.", "They didn't have cellphones in school.", "They're — it did not happen during their era.", "Our job is not to raise kids.", "Our job is to raise adults.", "Fully functioning adults who know how to interact with others, who are not so attached to their parents every hour of the day throughout school.", "At some point, you do have to cut the cord.", "The apron strings as they used to say.", "No one knows what an apron is anymore, so I don't say that.", "I had to make one at Home Ec because they wouldn't teach us real skills, okay?", "I wanted to work on cars, with the guys in the shop, but they didn't let us, okay?", "So, you have to cut the ties at some point.", "And one first grade teacher said to me, and I love talking to teachers, she says, “I'm fed up with the fact that every child, every six-year-old in my first grade class, has a smartwatch on that the parents send so they can be in touch with their child throughout the day, and they're like, ‘Oh, the teacher was mean to me, Mommy.’”", "They said they're getting phone calls from parents: “‘I just got sent to the office.’ Why are you sending my little girl to the office?”", "So, it's not functioning.", "And so, parents, I know it's hard because you need to go back to a time when you grew up, your parents did not keep track of you all day long.", "You did not have them as a crutch.", "And my God, if you forgot your lunch, two options: Borrow one of your friends, see if you can share a sandwich, or the next day, don't forget.", "And you won't forget the next day, right?", "Oh, because I hear that.", "“What if they forget their lunch? What if they have to make their after school plans?”", "Well, we'll give them the phone back after school and maybe they'll learn the skill of pre-planning their day.", "So, I want them to learn coping skills, resiliency and emerge as part of our New York State workforce — fully functioning — and we are the barriers because we're not being the heavies and saying no, and that's the path I'm on.", "I have to work with our Legislature.", "I have to do a lot more education on this because it's a change.", "But, none of us had it and we turned out okay, right?", "Linsey Davis, ABC News: I want to switch gears here for a minute because we are talking about — obviously, in the news — the devastation from Hurricane Milton, and when it comes to national disaster relief, quite often we're talking about money to build homes and jobs back again, food and all of that.", "But, when it comes to mental health assistance, what do you think the role of the state and federal government is at that point?", "Governor Hochul: They're absolutely right about the devastation — so many New Yorkers have a connection to Florida, right?", "My father's home, my sister's home, my brother's home and my aunt's home — all in St. Petersburg, heavily damaged.", "My aunt's home was already demolished two weeks ago.", "So, we have connections that are tighter than most other states, so I immediately sent our resources.", "I said, “Tell the governor we're on our way.”", "And, we sent helicopters, search and rescue — 65 people are down there now, we'll send more.", "So, there's that side of it, but the trauma inflicted on a community after an event like this is something we cannot overlook.", "This is like a community that has gone through a mass shooting.", "I refer back to Buffalo again.", "We had to provide mental health services to the survivors of the Tops shooting when ten people were gunned down and slaughtered in a grocery store in 2022 because of the color of their skin, and that's what that white supremacist 18-year-old said he was going to do.", "That community is trying to heal, but you need to provide services so we went in, our mental health teams went in to help them heal.", "The same thing should happen in communities where you see these people sobbing, standing their whole — everything they've built their whole lives, the baby pictures are in a puddle on the street and their wedding album and their clothes.", "It is so hard to see your whole life wiped away, and if we don't think that has an effect on your mental health and your sense of security forever, then we are wrong.", "So, we need to be more intentional and provide resources to local social service agencies and say, “Once the storm is cleaned up, don't assume their lives are cleaned up — that they're back to normal.”", "And so, being sensitive to that in government is the smart way to do it.", "These people need our help and that's what government is there to do.", "Linsey Davis, ABC News: And we're just about out of time, but I do want to ask one last question — which I think is a large overarching issue — which is, how do you destigmatize the idea of mental health?", "Because, a lot of people still — there is a fear or an embarrassment that I need a little help.", "I need to talk to somebody about this.", "Governor Hochul: That's when you get the validators that people trust.", "It's the hip hop artists, it's the athletes, it's the people that, people are watching their — I watch “Only Murders in the Building.”", "I mean, is that building actually here?", "I can't find it.", "I keep walking around.", "Linsey Davis, ABC News: I think it's on the Upper West Side.", "Governor Hochul: Okay, I keep walking around trying to find it.", "I walk around the City all the time.", "No one knows it's me, because I can put on a baseball hat and jeans and no one knows who I am, so it's great.", "So, I'm always walking around doing things.", "But, more people who do that — I think because we are a society that's impacted by influencers— Taylor Swift talks about it.", "I think that's an important part of it because it's really hard to break out of that, especially for men, I believe.", "But I'm really proud of even family members who say, “I have my weekly check in telehealth services with my therapist.” like, thank you.", "That’s smart, and tell your other friends you're doing that.", "And I do think that the telehealth services help destigmatize.", "You don't have to get up and go into an office and sit in a waiting room, and you might know somebody and you're all kind of like — I think that's a brilliant innovation that creates accessibility, even on your cell phone.", "I've got my appointment, I can talk to somebody.", "So, it has gotten much easier and stigma is a powerful negative force on people who should be seeking help.", "Whether it's from fentanyl addiction, or opioid addiction.", "I did commercials on this when I was Lieutenant Governor, trying to destigmatize getting help for those addictions and services that are provided.", "Same thing with mental health.", "So, there's not one answer, but forums like this, sharing information — I just talked about mental health on a podcast not long ago, and it's getting out there.", "So, I will do my role.", "Anything I can do in state government, you know.", "Whether it's public awareness campaigns, we always are doing this, but I'm open to ideas.", "I really am.", "We don't have all the answers, and I want to be helpful.", "I want to be not just investing, the government investing the most money ever, but having the best results.", "And it is my state where people dealt with the epicenter of the pandemic, we have to recognize that.", "And we're the ones who are very anxious about crime.", "I can tell everybody in the whole City that the crime rates, the murder rate in New York City is almost as low as it was in the 1960s.", "We have plummeted.", "Shootings are way down — but I can't tell you to feel good about that.", "And that's what we wrestle with.", "I want to change the psychology around this and it's hard, but we have to take it on and say, “I want people to feel good about the City.”", "Not just, “I'm supposed to feel better because the numbers are down.”", "I don't expect that.", "What I want to do is make people feel that they're safer, that their kids are going to be okay.", "And just try to remove some of the stress that is part of everyday life here, because this is an extraordinary place.", "And the benefits so outweigh the negative, and we have to keep focusing on the positive — because life is good.", "And people sometimes just need a little bit of help, and pulling them upwards and letting them grow.", "Letting them just really flourish, you know?", "And mental health is such an important part, it's the foundation of everything.", "It's everything.", "Linsey Davis, ABC News: Well, I think that forums like this, conversations like this, are so helpful.", "And step one, two three, right?", "Just to talk about it.", "And we appreciate so much you taking this time — your leadership and the initiatives that you have in order to try to make things better in particular, not just for us, but for our youth.", "And by extension of our youth, for all of us as the adults.", "So, we thank you so much.", "And we thank all of you for being such very intensive listeners today.", "And we do want to remind everybody here — I say it to you as I say it to myself as well, that we have to keep mental health top of mind, right?", "That is just

{"title": "Social media algorithms are driving the GLP-1 drugs boom - Verdict", "body": ["A rapid growth in demand for GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) medications has increased scrutiny around the relationship between patient-led recommendations – shared via ‘success stories’ on social media – and public health (both physical and mental).", "Concerns about misuse of the drugs, which are prescribed for the treatment of diabetes and obesity, have led to calls for greater moderation of medical and weight-loss content, as well as stricter advertising standards online.", "Already, worries around the recommendation of potentially harmful weight loss content to vulnerable young people have prompted some change.", "Most recently, this has included a policy shift by YouTube, which will adapt its algorithm to prevent the recommendation of content idealising specific fitness levels, physical features and body weights to children aged between 13 and 17.", "However, critics feel that GLP-1 RA drugs are becoming ‘glamorised’ by celebrities and influencers, including famous faces such as Elon Musk and Oprah Winfrey.", "Detractors argue that these figures neglect to explain the risks inherent to improper drug use, resulting in a culture that normalises unnecessary medication.", "This presents a twofold risk: firstly to the physical and mental health of those who do not need the drugs, and secondly (in the form of supply shortages) for those who do.", "The rise of GLP-1 RAs", "GLP-1 RAs mimic the action of the GLP-1 hormone, assisting in insulin production and suppressing appetite.", "Currently, they are produced by two major companies: Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.", "The former produces semaglutide, sold as Ozempic for type 2 diabetes patients, and Wegovy for treating obesity.", "Eli Lilly’s drug tirzepatide,  is sold to type 2 diabetics as Mounjaro, and marketed as Zepbound for treating obesity.", "“GLP-1 RAs are a drug class targeting the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1 receptor) in the body,” explains GlobalData pharmaceutical analyst Costanza Alciati.", "“This receptor is present in multiple tissues, hence the many effects of these drugs.”", "“GLP-1 RAs are currently approved and on the market for type 2 diabetes and obesity patients, as the main effects of the drugs are improving metabolic markers (e.g. reducing HbA1c levels, and improving insulin sensitivity) and causing weight loss (through targeting insulin resistance, but also the brain receptors, exerting an anorectic effect).”", "However, the rise has also prompted a wave of social media content recommending (directly or through personal ‘transformations’) GLP-1 RAs for cosmetic weight loss.", "Famously, members of the Osbourne family have used the drugs, despite having no known diabetes or obesity diagnoses.", "In June, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) warned against this, as supplies of GLP-1 RAs ran low, leaving those in need of medication at risk.", "In a statement, it said: “The use of GLP-1 receptor agonists for cosmetic weight loss in people without obesity or people with overweight who do not have weight-related health problems has been mentioned frequently in news outlets and social media and is worsening existing shortages.", "“The continued high demand for these medicines has also attracted criminal activity, increasing the risk of falsified products entering the market with serious consequences for public health.”", "Online: Pandora’s box", "Concerns about who is accessing this medication – and why – have become entangled in the debate around appropriate content moderation, and the material pushed by engagement-seeking algorithms.", "YouTube recently announced that its algorithm would no longer recommend content relating to body image to children between 13 and 17.", "While this material will still be available to younger viewers, it won’t be suggested based on other recently viewed material.", "In January, Meta (which owns Instagram and Facebook) updated its apps to hide search results relating eating disorders, as well as to suicide and self-harm.", "Instead, the apps now present a ‘help is available’ page, including a list of helplines and ‘suggestions from professionals outside of Meta’.", "However, there are still calls for tighter moderation, and there is disparity among platforms.", "Meta and YouTube’s moves stand in stark contrast to recent complaints around other platforms, including X – previously known as Twitter – which has come under criticism for its lack of moderation.", "In December 2023, the European Commission opened formal proceedings against X to establish whether it had breached the Digital Services Act (DSA) in regard to risk management, content moderation, dark patterns, advertising transparency and data access for researchers.", "Considering the impact of the online world on the mental health of young people, Olly Parker, head of external affairs at charity YoungMinds, says: “Record numbers of young people are being referred for help with their mental health and the online world is one of the big drivers. This is compounded by inequality, poverty, discrimination, insecure housing and an uncertain future. Add on intense academic pressure and it’s no wonder so many are struggling.”", "He continues: “Algorithms make it harder to take breaks from social media and serve content many find harmful. Many young people have told us they are routinely shown distressing content online that they didn’t ask for. They feel trapped and unable to leave social media sites and some say they spend more time than they would like to online.”", "The relationship between social media and users’ relationship with body image, has been well documented, but is complex and varied.", "According to some scholarship, social media content has the potential to improve body perception (posts connected to the recent body positivity movement being an example of this), although it can also enforce the status quo.", "Some studies have suggested little correlation between the rise of social media and body image issues, demonstrating instead that these concerns have long existed outside of digital spaces.", "A twelve-year study started in 2002, which took place across 33 countries in Europe and North America, found that 10 out of 33 countries saw a small increase in boys perceiving their body as “too fat” while no change was found over time for girls.", "This study coincided with the rise of social media platforms, but according to Catharina Wold Robson, honorary visiting fellow at department of sociology at the University of York, it demonstrates that “although the literature tells us that ‘certain social media use seems to be bad for body perception’ trend studies (over time) do not find that body image was worse in the years that social media became mainstream.”", "However, there is evidence that social media has powerful potential to exacerbate body image issues, even if it is not the sole cause.", "Expanding her point, Robson tells Pharmaceutical Technology that: “Certain behaviours, such as using visual platforms have been found to be more detrimental to body perception than text-based platforms, and that upward comparison (i.e. comparing oneself with someone you perceive as ‘better off’ rather than ‘worse off’ or ‘similar’) on social media can be detrimental to body perception.”", "While she notes holes in the final argument, she points to research by Pedalino and Camerini, which identifies that the passive use social media can have negative impact on body perception.", "For those already struggling, algorithm programming can quickly create an echo chamber and leave vulnerable users exposed to content that reinforces negative messages.", "This includes being recommended semaglutide and tirzepatide to lose weight.", "The risk of patient-led recommendations", "The increasing uptake of GLP-1 RAs (including by celebrities and influencers) has been reflected in content posted on social media platforms, and ‘success stories’ or ‘journeys’ have garnered interest and followers.", "As a result, conversations about the drugs have exploded on all major platforms.", "In most cases, content creators are looking to share their own legitimate experiences using semaglutide or tirzepatide in managing type 2 diabetes, or in achieving necessary weight loss.", "However, a rise in demand has fed fears that misinformation and the popularisation of these medications by famous faces is increasing the cosmetic use of the drugs.", "For vulnerable social media users, there is a risk that this content (sometimes posted by paid advertisers) might be recommending unnecessary and dangerous medication for which they mistakenly feel the need.", "Advertising any medication raises questions, particularly on platforms usually used to advertise consumer goods.", "Semaglutide and tirzepatide are being marketed alongside hair and beauty products, clothes, food and drink and other everyday items.", "In Europe, there is a ban on direct-to-consumer advertising (DCTA) of drugs to avoid this problem, but the US has no such law in place, and GLP-1 RAs are widely available through private healthcare providers who advertise on social media platforms.", "Expanding on this concern, Alciati notes that a lack of proper regulation around content advertised and sold on social media means the wrong people could be accessing the medication.", "“On social media, there are a lot of programmes that couple the weight loss drug with lifestyle changes and include shipping the drug at the patient’s home,” she says.", "“Such programmes could be useful to reach patients and increase awareness regarding the drug, but I think most of these don’t check whether the patient really has diabetes or is actually obese, which is a problem because it means we are still giving drugs to people who don’t really need them.”", "There is also a second risk: shortages.", "GLP-1RAs are, in Alciati’s words, “extraordinary drugs” for those who need them.", "However, with supply unable to match demand, there have been instances of diabetics struggling to obtain necessary treatment, leaving them at risk of hyperglycaemia.", "Doctors have raised concerns about the shortages, which were first identified in 2022.", "The EMA responded, saying: “Use outside its authorised use, such as for weight management in people who do not have diabetes, is considered off-label and affects the availability of the medicine to treat patients with type 2 diabetes.”", "Sign up for our daily news round-up!", "Give your business an edge with our leading industry

I’ve not been in the best of places. It’s a strange one because I’ve had a really brilliant year. Mental health-wise I’ve been doing really, really well.

It’s a testament to the Sheffield United community and the footballing community in content creation.”", "Jonny’s dad, Kevin, said: “I’m absolutely gobsmacked. The kindness of people is just totally unbelievable, the response has blown us away.

Their empathetic nature means that when you are sad, a donkey will often rest its heavy head on your shoulder, offering silent support.’", "Farmer and BBC’s Countryfile presenter Adam Henson concurs that their companionship is rewarding.", "‘Donkeys can really boost mental health,’ he enthuses.", "‘They stand there and let you stroke them — they have that nice, silky soft bit on the end of their nose. They are lovely creatures and will always come up to say hello.’", "Donkeys are in no short supply at Mr Henson’s Cotswold Farm Park at Guiting Power, Gloucestershire — he currently has a jack (the term for a male donkey), two young jennies (female) and three in-foal jennies — and if you’re ever on the hunt for something to make you smile after a long day, look no further than his YouTube Farm Diaries episode about donkeys.", "The footage of Mr Henson laughing as Sugar, a donkey foal, gallops joyfully in circles around him and her mother is sure to warm even the hardest of hearts.", "Faith Burden, the Donkey Sanctuary’s deputy chief executive, with 20-year-old Socrate.", "Credit: Millie Pilkngton", "‘We’ve had donkeys on the farm for as long as I can remember,’ he says.", "‘I always enjoy spending time with them and their foals are gorgeous. Visitors love to watch our donkeys and it’s wonderful for them to see the foals, especially in our barns during the Enchanted Light Trail at Christmas time.’", "Although a farm favourite, donkeys have long been misunderstood, often considered grumpy, stubborn or stupid — but this is a deeply unfair reputation that has arisen from the misinterpretation of their stoic, mindful nature.", "‘This whole idea around donkeys being stubborn and slow comes from their evolution, which plays an important role in understanding them,’ explains Faith Burden, deputy chief executive of The Donkey Sanctuary.", "‘Descended from African wild asses, donkeys evolved to survive in some of the toughest places on earth — mountainous environments with sparse vegetation and widely distributed water sources.", "That means their behaviour is different to a horse — if horses are startled, they run because they evolved on wide-open, grassy plains.", "For donkeys on steep, rocky, narrow terrain, however, fleeing wasn’t a good defence — they have a propensity to freeze and engage a “fight” response when threatened.", "They won’t run away blindly; they’re intelligent, calm, cautious and thoughtful.", "’", "This steady nature, combined with a long life expectancy — many live into their thirties — has shaped the donkey’s role as a domesticated working species.", "‘I always like to say there are many civilisations that were built on the back of a donkey,’ reflects Dr Burden.", "‘The relationship between humans and donkeys has been hugely beneficial to people and they still play a critical role in some of the world’s most vulnerable communities, indispensable to livelihoods. They have this quiet tenacity and humility — it was a donkey that carried Mary to Bethlehem and Jesus into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. It’s a real donkey trait to simply carry on.’", "Such fortitude and dependability, together with a natural curiosity and playfulness, makes them excellent trusted companions, she emphasises: ‘Donkeys bring a sense of calm and purpose to your life and bond closely with their human caregivers. Their behaviours are subtle, but once you get to know them, it really is a privilege.’", "This sentiment is shared by Jo Meehan, who first fell for the donkey’s charm 15 years ago.", "‘There were donkeys kept in the field opposite and as we drove home up the lane, they would come over to see us — they had a way of making us feel warm and happy,’ she recalls.", "‘When we decided to live somewhere more rural, the idea of owning donkeys became part of our house search.’", "Moving to Wales, Prof Meehan and her husband, Vinny, signed up to the donkey guardianship scheme run by The Donkey Sanctuary, embarking on a thorough two-year process before rehoming three donkeys: Ferguson, Edric and Spud.", "‘Ferguson is the gentle giant and by far the most confident — before he came to us, he spent time in donkey-assisted therapy sessions to help those struggling with anxiety. Edric is the oldest, but the smallest and it takes time to earn his trust. He’s the wise old man and the leader of the pack — if he goes somewhere, they all follow. Then we come to Spud, the naughty one. He’s so funny and playful, he loves to play with hula hoops and wellies — if something goes missing, we know who’s taken it,’ she laughs.", "Vinny and Jo Meehan with Edric, Spud and and Ferguson.", "A professor at the University of Liverpool Management School, Prof Meehan specialises in sustainability and made the decision to rewild the land on their smallholding with the donkeys’ needs in mind.", "‘There are about 15 different types of native grasses, wildflowers and wild herbs and we’ve worked with the Woodland Trust to reinstate the hedgerows and plant a new woodland,’ she says.", "‘It’s great for the donkeys’ health and mental enrichment — all the smells and the shade of the trees — but it’s wonderful for us, too.", "We look out at those various shades of green and all the colours of the rainbow in the flowers.", "’", "There’s nothing quite like the greeting each morning of a donkey’s happy brays on seeing you, Prof Meehan concludes.", "Their extraordinary ability to read the energy of those around them continues to amaze her: ‘They’re beautiful, wise, sentient creatures — if you’re feeling stressed or anxious, they seek you out and stand by you. They take time to observe your behaviours before making a decision. We can learn a lot from donkeys — they judge a person on their actions.’", "The joy inspired by the presence of donkeys has long been valued by the residents of Clovelly in north Devon, a picturesque fishing village perched on a 400ft cliff with no vehicular access, where, for centuries, these animals have been integral to the way of life.", "Once used to carry goods up the steep, narrow, cobbled streets — before they were replaced by wooden sleds — the famous Clovelly donkeys are synonymous with the charm of the village and have become a huge draw for tourists.", "‘We currently have four young male donkeys, each with their own character.", "People adore them,’ enthuses John Rous, custodian of the Clovelly estate.", "‘We’re enormously proud of them. When a bride from the village gets married, the donkeys accompany her up the street and they appear in church on Palm Sunday. So far, they’ve always behaved marvellously during the service — we do hold our breath each year, however.’", "Although their role may have evolved, Mr Rous insists the donkeys are as important to Clovelly as they’ve always been.", "‘Nowadays, they’re largely on photographic duty, truth be told,’ he laughs.", "‘They parade around the village, much admired and enjoying a very relaxed, Bertie Wooster-type of life.’", "Katy Birchall is an author and journalist", "The modern hedgelayer’s role is no longer that of a fencer, but instead a practical conservationist creating vibrant, thorny arteries", "A creature of bewitching contrasts, the otter is ‘an animal that might have been specifically designed to please a child’", "No tea party is complete without a four-hoofed friend in attendance, says Flora Watkins.", "Just be mindful of where you", "Some treasured native farm animals have fallen dangerously low in numbers.", "Kate Green meets the breeders keeping the flame alive."], "provider": {"name": "countrylife.co.uk", "domain": "countrylife.co.uk"}, "publication_date": "2024-09-27T00:00:00+00:00", "label": 0}

today.", "And there is no one better to reflect on this than our mom-Governor, Governor Hochul.", "So there are two massive clusters of changing norms colliding over this past decade.", "Parents driven a lot by anxiety and concerns have been buying smartphones for their kids.", "How do I keep my kids safe in school?", "With mental health challenges and bullying, how can I make sure my kid is okay during the day?", "And then, can I ensure my kid is keeping up with the technology?", "And then let's not forget that the smartphone and video game and social media industries have focused on maximizing and monetizing screen time.", "So now these trends are complex and interdependent, but there is leadership that is going to help address this.", "And so it is a pleasure to be in conversation with Governor Hochul on this.", "Now, I want to know what your aha moment is, and I do think this is a moment to reflect on personal experience.", "We were just talking backstage, I have an eight-year-old in the public school system here in New York City.", "This became a big issue over the last few weeks.", "And I was properly shocked because he's eight.", "And so this is something that quite honestly all of us need to be thinking about.", "And so, Governor Hochul, through your personal experiences or insights, can you tell us what influenced you to really focus on this issue from a legislative perspective?", "Governor Hochul: Thank you, Penny, and for Concordia for elevating this issue.", "I was here last year talking about climate change, and I'm always happy to talk about that.", "I can give you the speech I gave a few hours ago.", "But this is something a year ago I would not have thought we'd be talking about here.", "But I am so happy that this has finally taken hold because as a mom, a parent, you are hardwired to protect your children.", "Full stop.", "You wake up in the morning, start thinking about them when they're little, late at night when they're out with their friends you don't sleep until they're back home.", "That’s how we are.", "And as the Governor of New York, my number one job also has to be to protect all New Yorkers.", "So, you asked what my aha moment was.", "About a year and a half ago, I started convening mental health roundtables because we knew we were starting to see the signs that young people in particular had not fully emerged from the pandemic.", "They are still stressed out.", "The statistics on suicide, especially for teenage girls contemplating suicide, the depression, the anxiety, it was off the charts.", "So, I started having meetings and gathering kids and talking all over the state, and there was one not that long ago where the young woman – we started talking about the impact of social media and how it really takes hold of them.", "They're held captive to these algorithms that are designed to bombard them with information that they will like because it's taking personal information about them and turning it around and pulling them in deeper and deeper.", "And I said to this young woman – she was telling me how “I'm getting bullied during the day and all these social media and everybody's doing this and I'm missing out and I have FOMO,” I said, “What do you want us to do?”", "She goes, “You have to save us from ourselves.”", "And that was my aha moment, when I realized it's hard for parents to say you're going to be the only teenager in the school without a cell phone, it's hard for the school district to take it on and say, “We're going to be the heavies,” teachers have enough on their plates, they don't have to be the enforcers.", "And I realized this calls for government intervention, and I'm not afraid to take on the fights, especially when we're fighting for our kids' mental health.", "That was when I said, “Let's find out what we can do to control these social media companies,” and we can talk about our nation-leading legislation, but also I'm right now developing a policy that's going to say, “Bell to bell, full school day, phones should not be in the hands of children because they're being denied the chance to learn, the teachers are frustrated that they're not paying attention anymore, but also it has taken them to negative places, and it's horrible for their mental health.”", "Penny Abeywardena: It really is.", "And different levels at different ages and grades, the impact is even more optimized, right?", "” Now, it would be great if you could talk about the significance of the first-in-the-nation law you signed to combat addictive social media feeds.", "And I will say, I hope many of you realize this, Instagram changed their policy last week, and I'm assuming it's because they're seeing the serious movement that's coming from around the country, led by –", "Governor Hochul: Well, that's true.", "In the era of – waiting for industries to self-regulate in the best interest of consumers is probably never going to happen.",

lawyers, I can hire any lawyer in the state I want so bring it on.", "But I'd rather not.", "I said, “Why don't you get out of the courtroom and come into my conference room and help devise solutions,

This is an impossibility.”", "It's like, “You're tech companies, you can do anything, figure it out.”", "And somehow, magically, Instagram announced last week, they figured it out.", "I have immense faith in their ability to solve problems even if it's against their self-interest.", "Penny Abeywardena: And that's really bringing everybody to the table.", "When we think about the efficacy of what you've been able to do, it really came down to really strategic collaborations.", "Can you talk about how you worked not only with parents and teachers, but unions?", "We talked about authorities and the police; I’d just be curious how everybody's playing a part in all of this?", "Governor Hochul: That's a great question because you can't go into these battles alone, right?", "You have to have allies as you march into war.", "And here's what we needed to have.", "First of all, many parents on their own have said they know how bad it is.", "They've seen their children, especially if they were able to get a cell phone at age 12, 13, 14, they turn into a different person.", "First of all, they lose the capacity over time to have real, genuine social interactions.", "They don't make eye contact.", "They don't talk to other students.", "In school, the cafeteria is silent.", "They're silent when they're in the schoolyard.", "They're silent in the halls.", "And the school districts that – on their own – were courageous enough to ban them said they now hear children laughing, talking, even arguing, they're communicating more.", "And it was stopped.", "It was a dead silence.", "It was so unnatural.", "So, I had to get teachers on board, that was the easiest one.", "72 percent of teachers across this country say that they are tired of the distractions and their inability to communicate with students or make connections in a way that are positive relationships.", "This is, outside a parent, the most influential person in their lives is a teacher.", "And the teacher is trying to do the best they can, and they're being thwarted.", "They're not learning, but they're also not making connections.", "They're stunted in their growth.", "They're not turning into young adults eventually, over time, and ultimately adults.", "And we needed teachers on board, principals on board, school districts on board, and I said in all my – I did roundtables all over the state with all these parties at the table.", "I said, “I'll be the heavy, just blame me, say, ‘that mean Governor made us do this,’ I mean I'll take that on.”", "Because as a mom, I know how important this is and it would have helped me enormously to tell my kids, “I would have let you have the cell phones in school, but hey, it's the law, I can't let you do that. I still love you and I'd let you do anything else.”", "It's about relationships, the ability to say no, which I have no trouble saying to my kids, but some do.", "But I also need law enforcement, and this is interesting, because my kids were in middle school during Columbine, the very high-profile mass shooting, and you still say the word ‘Columbine,’ I get chills because I know what it did to my sense of security.", "And we have so many other cases since then, I just spoke about Uvalde at another forum.", "So I thought, I have to think about how this affects parents' sense of security when they say goodbye to their most precious little child, whether it's kindergarten or 12th grade.", "I talked to law enforcement, what they said was so striking.", "If there is a crisis on campus or in the schoolyard, in the school, a mass shooting, worst case scenario, the last thing you want children to be doing, the last thing, is looking at their cell phone, texting mom and dad, sending messages, maybe videoing because they want to be the one who captures this.", "First of all, you're telegraphing where you are, okay?", "You'll hear this.", "Also, the police said to me the place their attention has to be is not on their smartphone, it has to be on the front of the classroom where the teacher is going to lead them to safety.", "When I heard that, it was like the clouds parted.", "I said, that's the argument for parents.", "They need to hear that.", "So we're not through yet.", "I've proposed this and loosely I said I'm going to be developing a policy.", "I will be working with these same groups I just mentioned.", "Everybody to let them understand how important this is and it's also when I think about employers in my state, I want to be able to let them know that when young people emerge from their educational process, they'll be fully functioning adults who have social interaction skills, who'll be able to have the creative collisions and talk to someone else, a colleague, and work in teams and strategize together and really be more productive instead of someone who's, again, their existence for a number of years has just been with the virtual world.", "And I can't control what happens after school.", "Like my nieces are on all night long.", "I said, who are they talking to all night long?", "Isn't anybody sleeping?", "And so they're not, because they're talking to kids on the other side of the world, literally.", "So we also say no notifications, and parents have the ability to turn it off.", "Sorry, kids, you can't have it on from midnight until 6 a.m.", "I think Instagram actually said 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., which I thought was extraordinary.", "So parents are being empowered.", "So now we have to educate the parents.", "This is what it looks like, this is how you handle it, and when your teenager gets, tries to get around it, this is how you undo what they did.", "We have to help the parents get through this as well, but ultimately, imagine a world where this never happened.", "We're not dealing with these high rates of depression and anxiety in young people and the bullying that goes on in schools.", "One mom said her husband has to leave work every day to be there at the end of the day when the child comes home from school because he gets picked on so badly on his own cell phone, watching it all day long, people are saying that he's about to commit suicide and they want to keep an eye on him.", "If that doesn't hit you as a parent – what is happening?", "But a world where we say, no cell phones, we just go back to the way it was when we were younger.", "Penny Abeywardena: Yeah.", "Governor Hochul: And if you need to – forget your lunch or you need to figure out how you're getting home at the end of the day, guess what?", "There's phones in the office.", "It's a radical idea.", "Go down the hall, talk to your counselor, talk to your principal, can I use the phone?", "Penny Abeywardena: Talk to someone.", "Governor Hochul: And maybe forget your lunch and you go hungry;

We're getting our kids back. They're acting like normal, carefree kids who are not just so stressed out every day about someone who's going to be sending a message or someone who's mocking them out on social media.”", "Even the

do, you know, perform in a school play because they're going to be, you know, captured on video and it's going to go viral in the school, and everybody's going to mock them out.", "This has an effect that I don't think people could have foreseen.", "But the bottom line is this: they're supposed to be paying attention and learning in school.", "They have plenty of hours, once they leave that school, to engage with anybody they want to talk to in their free time, with their parents’ involvement, and I'm just talking about let them start to learn again and act like children.", "Amna Nawaz, PBS News Hour: Governor, I wouldn't be doing my job as a journalist if I didn't ask you about recent news about your office, and that was the story that broke yesterday about your former Deputy Chief of Staff, Linda Sun, who was arrested and charged with acting as an undisclosed agent of the Chinese government.", "Your office has made clear she'd been fired in March of 2023 for misconduct, and you are cooperating with law enforcement.", "But is there anything else you can tell us about that case?", "Governor Hochul: Absolutely shocking.", "And she has been in government for many, many years, even prior to the time I became governor, where she was involved in making a lot of decisions related to the relationship between the administration at the time and the Chinese government promoting Chinese, you know, viewpoints and giving them proclamations and visas.", "And actually, atthe same time, really diminishing any involvement with the country of Taiwan.", "It is shocking in its scale.", "I'm glad we were able to see some evidence that didn't look right to us.", "And we immediately alerted the authorities, and hence we have this outcome.", "And I would also just say this: to think that any foreign agent, any foreign government has the audacity to infiltrate a government organization like the State of New York — has to be addressed.", "And we'll be talking more about what we want to see happen today, but I will say this — everyone should be aware who they are empowering with positions.", "Again, she was doing more Proclamations and outreach to the community.", "She had no access to documentation or security information at all — or cyber security.", "So, there was a limit to it.", "On the other hand, it never should have happened.", "And we're taking strong actions at this time, again cooperating with the Eastern District of New York fully to make sure that they have everything they need from us.", "Amna Nawaz, PBS News Hour: Finally, it wouldn't be a Washington DC panel if I didn't ask you about politics.", "So, I have to ask, related to the upcoming elections — because it wasn't too long ago that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has lamented time and again the loss of five New York congressional seats in 2022.", "She mentioned it multiple times in a recent interview with me as well.", "And recently when she was asked why she thinks that happened, she said, “I think it related to the Gubernatorial race.”", "Do you think that it did?", "Governor Hochul: No.", "The same year we lost five seats in California.", "So, I think there's a broader analysis that would be justified.", "Amna Nawaz, PBS News Hour: And when you look ahead, do you think that Democrats can flip those seats back in November?", "Governor Hochul: I sure do, that's why I'm devoting an enormous amount of my energy.", "The last time I had been Governor just for a very short time, I just ascended into the role unexpectedly.", "And now that I'm through that I'm laser focused.", "I'm

{"title": "Social Media Use Measures: Critical Considerations for Supporting Adolescent Mental Wellbeing · Youth Wellbeing in a Technology Rich World", "body": ["Introduction", "Adolescents represent one important group of individuals who may experience distinct mental wellbeing benefits and risks associated with technology use.", "Nearly all United States adolescents report smartphone ownership, and almost half describe themselves as constantly connected (Anderson and Jiang 2018).", "Most of these youth report that they maintain social media accounts, of which YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok are particularly popular (Anderson and Jiang 2018; Richter 2020).", "These technology usage patterns underscore the importance of research and design approaches to attend to the impacts of technology use on adolescent mental wellbeing, toward promoting benefits and minimizing risks.", "Such approaches need to address developmental forces relevant to all adolescents and meaningful differences among adolescents based on their identities, contexts, and the ways in which they use and experience technologies.", "In recent years, national discourse has given much attention to how technology use may impact adolescent mental-wellbeing.", "This dialogue has often involved news media stories centered on social media screen time, with implications that any and all social media use is the same and causes negative mental wellbeing outcomes (Newton 2023; Parks 2023).", "However, this perspective is not aligned with evidence, which has not consistently supported that there are associations between social media screen time and mental wellbeing outcomes (Odgers, Schueller, and Ito 2020).", "That is not to say there is no evidence of associations between patterns of social media use and mental wellbeing outcomes.", "For example, a condition called problematic social media use has reliably shown associations with depression and anxiety (Hussain and Griffiths 2018).", "Thus, discourse with a sole focus on screen time does not lend adequate nuance to understanding social media usage patterns and mental wellbeing outcomes.", "This narrower focus limits the scope of proposed approaches to support adolescent mental wellbeing to addressing time spent on social media, while overlooking other important features of use which could benefit mental wellbeing or provide important prevention and intervention targets.", "If the aim is to support adolescent mental wellbeing, research and design approaches must account for diversity of social media use; doing so requires careful attention to social media use measures.", "Understanding key categories of social media use requires direct input from youth.", "Youth perspectives can provide insights into the intersections between social media measures and lived experiences.", "Notably, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child has described an obligation for researchers to consult youth on matters that affect them (UNICEF 1995).", "To this end, we collaborated with four youth authors, who are members of our team's youth advisory boards and are between the ages of 17 and 19.", "Youth authors met and discussed their own experiences and appraisals around interpreting key categories of social media use measures.", "Each youth author then contributed their perspective on a category of social media measure or considerations for interpretation.", "Youth authors reviewed this chapter to ensure it represents their views accurately, and all met criteria for authorship and have been included as co-authors.", "In this way, youth authors offer critical perspectives toward understanding and interpreting social media measures for adolescents.", "This chapter reviews three key categories of social media use measures for adolescents: screen time, interactions and activities, and problematic use.", "For each measure, definitions and conceptual assumptions are provided alongside evidence behind these assumptions and youth perspectives.", "Implications for approaches to support adolescent mental wellbeing are discussed.", "Finally, key considerations for the interpretation of social media measures and adolescent mental wellbeing outcomes are described.", "Screen Time", "Definition", "Screen time measures assess the time an individual spends using social media.", "These measures seek to quantify minutes or hours spent using social media in a given time frame, regardless of the activity carried out on the platform.", "Screen time on social media can be assessed using one of five approaches.", "First, self-report questions may ask about the time, such as minutes or hours, in a time frame such as a day or week, spent using any social media platform (Odgers et al. 2020).", "This approach may ask open-ended questions or provide multiple choice answers that provide a time range, such as 1-2 or 3-4 hours per week.", "Second, the frequency of using social media may be examined through questions targeting how many times a person checks or logs into social media in a given time frame (Brailovskaia and Margraf 2018).", "Third, time spent or frequency of using specific social media platforms, such as Facebook and Tumblr, may be assessed (Brailovskaia and Margraf 2018).", "The fourth approach does not rely on self-reported data, but uses passive sensing.", "In this approach, data about technology behaviors are captured through application usage information, such as calling, texting, or GPS (Cornet and Holden 2018).", "Often, passive sensing involves downloading an application to a smartphone that transmits data from the phone to a research database.", "In the case of social media research, such data may include time spent using given social media applications.", "Finally, Ecological Momentary Assessment is an approach that allows real-time data collection of social media use and mental wellbeing information through self-report (Shiffman et al. 2008).", "Prompts are often delivered multiple times a day over the course of a time period such as a week, commonly via text message, and participants are asked to respond as soon as they are able.", "Assumptions", "With screen time measures, an hour of posting photos and writing captions would be recorded identically to an hour of scrolling through other users’ photos without adding any content.", "Thus, a key assumption of screen time measures is that all social media use is similar, regardless of varying features engaged with or patterns of use.", "When it comes to mental wellbeing outcomes, the quantity, not quality, of social media activities is used as the key predictor.", "Evidence", "Regarding mental wellbeing outcomes, a review suggests that screen time self-report measures have not been demonstrated to be consistent predictors of mental wellbeing (Odgers et al. 2020).", "This review argues that findings about associations between screen time self-report and mental wellbeing have been mixed.", "Many studies have not supported social media screen time as an influence on mental wellbeing, and those providing evidence of such a connection have found very small effect sizes, showing social media to be a relatively minor influence.", "These observations have led some researchers to recommend moving away from a focus on screen time, and instead attending to how individuals use social media (Orben 2020).", "An additional, important consideration regarding evidence around the use of screen time measures is their accuracy and reliability.", "A significant challenge with screen time self-report measures is recall bias, which occurs when research participants do not remember previous experiences accurately (Porta 2013).", "A previous study found that self-report of social media use was consistently higher than accurate measures obtained using Ecological Momentary Assessment, in which text messages were used to assess real-time technology use experiences (Moreno, Jelenchick, Koff et al. 2012).", "Similarly, a systematic review showed that digital media use self-report is only moderately associated with logs used to track digital media use (Parry, Davidson, Sewall et al. 2021).", "Thus, recall bias may be a significant threat to accurate measurement of social media screen time through self-report, and findings using these measures should be regarded with caution.", "One approach that circumvents recall bias commonly associated with screen time self-report measures is through passive sensing, which can collect accurate usage information by directly gathering smartphone usage data.", "Previous studies of passive sensing have tended to focus on features of general smartphone use or offline behaviors rather than social media use (Choudhary, Thomas, Ellenberger et al. 2022; Fukazawa, Ito, Okimura et al. 2019; Meyerhoff, Liu, Kording et al. 2021; Sarda, Munuswamy, Sarda et al. 2019; Wang, Chen, Chen et al. 2014).", "Some of these studies have found associations between certain smartphone use patterns and increased self-reported depression or social anxiety symptoms (Choudhary et al. 2022; Fukazawa et al. 2019; Meyerhoff et al. 2021; Sarda et al. 2019), but most of these associations have been weak.", "Further, some studies have also found associations between certain features of smartphone use and increased mental wellbeing (Choudhary et al. 2022; Meyerhoff et al. 2021).", "Thus, even though passive sensing measures are likely to be more accurate than screen time self-report, it may be that associations between these measures and mental wellbeing outcomes show similar patterns to screen time self-report.", "Previous work using Ecological Momentary Assessment may offer some insight into inconsistent associations between social media screen time and mental wellbeing.", "One study using this methodology found that almost half of adolescents reported better moods after using social media, while about 10% reported worse moods (Beyens et al. 2020).", "These findings support that individual adolescents may experience unique mental wellbeing outcomes when using social media, and the authors argue that features of the individual adolescent’s life context are critical to consider.", "Youth author perspective: Janice Peng", "Challenges with screen time measures include the inaccuracy of self-report as well as the lack of distinction between different interactions and activities on social media.", "Further, screen time by itself is not a reliable indicator of how social media use affects mental wellbeing.", "Considering these challenges, one approach may be to disregard screen time measures altogether.", "On the other hand, although social media interactions and activities are likely important to consider, an adolescent can have certain interactions on social media very seldom or very often.", "The frequency of these interactions may affect mental wellbeing outcomes.", "Thus, another approach is to use screen time measures in conjunction with other measures.", "Assessing how much time someone spends on different uses of social media would be a useful alternative or addition to assessing general social media screen time.", "This data could be collected using passive sensing that records the amount of time someone spends on each type of activity.", "This would provide more accurate data and account for different types of use.", "One challenge would be to ensure that passive sensing technology can be designed to collect information on different activity types.", "Another challenge is that this method may collect a great deal of information, and care would need to be taken to ensure a participant's privacy, especially as young people and their guardians may need thorough explanations about how the data is being collected and used.", "Nevertheless, a key application of screen time may be to assess time spent on specific social media interactions and activities.", "Implications", "Screen time measures treat all social media use as the same.", "One reason associations between social media screen time and adolescent mental wellbeing are not consistently supported by evidence may be that they do not capture the wide range of social media activities in which one can engage.", "Example interactions may include viewing other users’ posts and stories, uploading one’s own photos, or creating accounts without one’s personal information that are hidden from family and friends.", "Given the degree to which these activities differ from one another, their effects on mood and wellbeing may also be distinct.", "Indeed, growing evidence suggests that different ways of interacting with social media platforms are associated with different mental wellbeing outcomes (Escobar-Viera, Shensa, Bowman et al. 2018; Moreno, Binger, Minich et al. 2022b), and that the nature of these associations may depend on features of an individual’s identity, such as gender (Allen, Stratman, Kerr et al. 2021).", "Thus, a focus on screen time measures is likely to generate sweeping guidelines about time spent on social media, without attention to specific activities that may be associated with important benefits or risks for mental wellbeing.", "Such guidelines are not supported by a strong body of evidence; accordingly, the American Academy of Pediatrics no longer provides guidelines for screen time (AAP Council on Communications and Media 2016).", "To be sure, screen time frequency measures, if they are accurate, may be a useful indicator of social media platforms that are gaining popularity, which could be important in guiding future dialogue and research.", "Another application of screen time measures may be to combine them with interactions and activities measures, so that the frequency of engaging in such activities can be captured.", "However, screen time measures alone are unlikely to capture adequate nuance in understanding social media use to target strategies for supporting adolescent mental wellbeing.", "Interactions and Activities", "Definition", "Interactions and activities represent a second category of measure of adolescent social media use.", "This framework emphasizes the type of interactions or activities in which one engages on social media platforms, such as creating posts or viewing content generated by other users.", "Assumptions", "When interactions and activities measures are used, the many possible ways one can engage with social media are differentiated.", "For example, creating and uploading a TikTok video would be viewed as a substantially different experience than scrolling through videos uploaded by others.", "Further, in this framework, an assumption is that adolescents engage with various social media interactions and activities at different rates.", "Thus, it would be hypothesized that varying manners and patterns of social media use would be associated with differing mental wellbeing benefits and risks.", "Evidence", "Interactions and activities approaches are supported by such conceptual models as uses and gratifications theory and affordances.", "Uses and gratifications theory argues that individuals make decisions to interact with media based on their needs and beliefs about what they will gain from doing so (Blumler and Katz 1974).", "A previous study identified ten uses and gratifications of social media use, including social interaction, information seeking, and entertainment (Whiting and Williams 2013).", "This model suggests that individual adolescents have unique needs which influence the interactions they have with social media.", "Affordances, on the other hand, emphasize elements of a social media platform that could influence how it is used.", "Affordances are a concept used in fields involved with technology design and refer to design properties that influence the way a user will engage with an object (Zhao, Liu, Tang et al. 2013).", "In this model, social media features such as video upload options and news feeds, for example, are expected to facilitate different patterns of use.", "Previous work has identified four affordances associated with social media use (Moreno and D'Angelo 2019), including cultivating and managing", "1) identity,", "2) social connections,", "3) cognitive development and learning, and", "4) emotions.", "Thus, an affordance model suggests that individual social media platforms offer features that can impact how the technology is used.", "Taken together, usage and gratifications and affordance frameworks support that adolescent social media usage patterns may involve an interplay between the uses and gratifications one seeks and the affordances a social media platform offers.", "Interplay between adolescent uses and gratifications and affordances around social media use is supported by a study on the development of the validated Adolescent Digital Technology Interactions and Importance (ADTI) scale (Moreno, Binger, Zhao et al. 2020).", "This scale includes 18 items reflecting individual technology interactions, which fall into three subscales:", "1) technology to bridge online/offline experiences,", "2) technology to go outside one’s identity or offline environment, and", "3) technology for social connection.", "This study found differences in the importance adolescents place on each subscale and supported that there are differences between social media interactions and activities.", "Further, interactions and their associations with mental wellbeing may differ between groups of adolescents.", "One previous study found differences in associations between importance of technology interactions and certain mental wellbeing outcomes between cisgender and transgender, nonbinary, and gender-diverse youth (Allen et al. 2021).", "Thus, the development of the ADTI scale provides empirical support that adolescents interact with technology, particularly social media, in differing ways.", "Previous work supports that varying ways of interacting with social media are associated with unique mental wellbeing benefits and risks.", "One interactions and activities measure that has been explored extensively in previous research is active and passive use of social media (Verduyn, Lee, Park et al. 2015).", "According to this framework, active social media usage involves creating new content, such as posts or comments, that promotes engagement with other users.", "Passive usage, on the other hand, refers to viewing others’ social media content, but not self-generating content.", "Several studies have found associations between passive social media usage and negative mental wellbeing outcomes (Escobar-Viera et al. 2018; Frison and Eggermont 2016; Rousseau, Eggermont and Frison 2017; Thorisdottir, Sigurvinsdottir, Asgeirsdottir et al. 2019), possibly due to passive usage fostering less meaningful social connections than active usage (Dienlin and Johannes 2020).", "However, other work has found a lack of evidence that passive usage causes poor mental wellbeing, suggesting passive usage may instead be the result of poorer mental wellbeing (Aalbers, McNally, Heeren et al. 2019).", "Thus, previous work has consistently shown associations between passive usage and poorer mental wellbeing, though causal mechanisms behind this relationship remain unclear.", "An additional interactions and activities framework that has been associated with mental wellbeing benefits and risks is the multiple self-presentation framework, which argues that social media users may present their real selves (describing oneself accurately), ideal selves (describing an aspirational self), and false selves (intentionally mischaracterizing oneself) on social media platforms.", "These interactions have been assessed using the Self-Presentation-on-Facebook-Questionnaire (SPFBQ) (Michikyan, Dennis and Subrahmanyam 2015).", "Previous work shows associations between presentations of the real self and better mental wellbeing as well as between presentations of the ideal or false self and poorer wellbeing (Mun and Kim 2021; Wright, White and Obst 2018).", "Researchers have hypothesized that these associations may reflect that adolescents who experience more self-doubt spend more time on social media exploring parts of themselves they seek to understand better (Michikyan et al. 2015).", "Thus, interactions and activities measures, such as multiple self-presentation and active and passive usage frameworks, have shown some social media uses to be associated with positive mental wellbeing outcomes and others with negative mental wellbeing outcomes.", "Youth author perspective: Natasha Matta", "While interactions and activities approaches such as active and passive and multiple self-presentation framework provide important insight into how adolescents use social media, these social media uses may be more nuanced in real life than currently described in research.", "Research approaches should acknowledge that interactions and activities on social media are likely to occur on a spectrum.", "For example, social media use may fall on a spectrum from active to passive use.", "Commenting on another user’s post, for instance, may be considered more active than simply viewing another person’s post but more passive than creating a post or story on one’s own account or page.", "Uses that do not fall on either end of the spectrum may have different implications for mental wellbeing risks and outcomes that are overlooked in current research.", "There may also be combinations of interactions and activities.", "An adolescent may represent both their real and ideal selves, and they may engage in commenting on some posts and only viewing others.", "These activities may hold a different meaning when considered together rather than individually.", "Users also switch between different interactions and activities rapidly, for example, posting a status update and then passively scrolling through posts on their feed.", "Additionally, they may switch rapidly between social media apps.", "It follows that the overall patterns of interactions and activities on social media should be considered, rather than individual uses.", "Implications", "Interactions and activities frameworks are premised on the notion that there are important differences between ways of using social media.", "In this framework, guidelines to support mental wellbeing would address beneficial and risky patterns of interacting with social media.", "This approach is supported by previous research, which provides evidence of importantly different interactions and activities on social media and distinct associations with mental wellbeing benefits and risks.", "At the same time, a key point is that certain interactions and activities are not mutually exclusive of others and likely occur on a spectrum.", "Rather than being only active users or real self presenters, individual adolescents likely show patterns of many interactions and activities.", "Thus, compared to screen time measures, interactions and activities measures offer a more nuanced set of understandings for what forms of technology engagement influences wellbeing.", "Problematic Use", "Definition", "A third category of measures of social media use is problematic use, which includes concerning patterns that may emerge in the relationship between individuals and social media platforms.", "Such patterns include the interference of social media with daily activities and the experience of distress or withdrawal when social media cannot be used (Andreassen, Pallesen and Griffiths 2017; Elphinston and Noller 2011).", "Assumptions", "Rather than focusing on the time or activities engaged with on social media, problematic use measures characterize the relationship that can develop between a social media platform and its users.", "Generally, it is assumed that social media sites have certain characteristics that can facilitate use that may fall on a spectrum from non-problematic to impulsive, compulsive, or addictive use, which in turn can disrupt the user’s daily life.", "Thus, the development of this concerning relationship with the social media platform has the potential to be associated with mental wellbeing outcomes.", "Evidence", "Three key scales have been developed to assess problematic use of social media.", "One approach is the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale (BFAS), which includes six items representing core elements of addiction (Andreassen, Torsheim, Brunborg et al. 2012).", "This scale has been adapted to the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS), following the rise in popularity of additional social media platforms, and broadens the focus to include any social media platform (Andreassen et al. 2017).", "A similar framework for measuring problematic use of social media is Facebook intrusion, which refers to Facebook use or an attachment to Facebook that interferes with daily activities and causes distress that spills from Facebook into other activities (Elphinston and Noller 2011; Przepiorka and Blachnio 2020).", "Across the BFAS, BSMAS, and Facebook intrusion scales, studies have consistently found associations between problematic use of social media and negative mental wellbeing outcomes.", "Previous research has reliably shown small to moderate, negative associations between problematic social media use and wellbeing indicators (Huang 2022).", "Research also shows positive relationships between problematic social media use and anxiety, depression, and distress (Huang 2022; Malaeb, Salameh, Barbar et al. 2021; Marino, Gini, Vieno et al. 2018; Shensa, Escobar-Viera, Sidani et al. 2017).", "Similarly, Facebook intrusion has been linked to depression (Elphinston and Noller 2011; Przepiorka and Blachnio 2020).", "Thus, problematic social media use may be an important predictor of negative mental wellbeing outcomes for adolescents.", "Though problematic social media use may be consistently associated with negative mental wellbeing outcomes, an additional, important factor to consider is the prevalence of adolescents affected by this condition.", "Previous work estimates that 6-9% of adolescents meet criteria for problematic social media use (van Duin, Heinz, Willems 2021; Paakkari et al. 2021).", "Thus, it is not likely that most adolescents develop this condition.", "Youth author perspective: Armaan Bhasin", "Although not all adolescents may screen positive for problematic social media use, it is important to note that one’s relationship with social media occurs on a spectrum between healthy and problematic, and not just a threshold that categorizes social media use as problematic or not.", "This spectrum may be affected by external factors in the adolescent’s life.", "For example, problematic use may vary during different times of the year.", "Social media usage is largely a function of how much free time an individual has.", "For example, usage might increase during the summer or winter break when adolescents have greater amounts of free time, but then decrease during the school year or during final exams week.", "It is important to recognize that to some extent, factors such as homework, sports, extracurriculars and academics naturally prevent excessive social media use throughout the year.", "This limits the amount of problematic usage adolescents could have during certain times of the year which contributes to why problematic social media usage likely falls on a spectrum.", "In addition to the time of the year, problematic social media usage is also dependent on the social media platform the adolescent uses.", "For instance, TikTok is a primarily scrolling-based platform featuring short user-created videos.", "Viewers are shown a unique “For You” page, which provides videos based on their preferences.", "These preferences are quickly learned by TikTok’s algorithm.", "This aspect of TikTok has been described in terms of the app having unique structural elements that make it “addicting” (Petrillo 2021).", "Thus, individual social media platforms are also important to consider in conjunction with problematic use of social media.", "Implications", "A problematic social media use framework assumes that social media platforms have characteristics that can facilitate a spectrum of usage patterns between non-problematic, impulsive, compulsive, and addictive use.", "Evidence supports that some, but not most, adolescents develop this condition, and for them, there are associated negative mental wellbeing outcomes.", "Thus, prevention and intervention efforts for these adolescents are important.", ".", "At the same time, research and intervention design approaches should give careful attention to screening for problematic use of social media.", "Not all social media use, perhaps not even high-frequency social media use, is likely to meet criteria for problematic social media use.", "For many adolescents, social media use is not associated with addiction symptoms like withdrawal or disruptions to daily life.", "At the same time, an adolescent’s relationship to social media may be influenced by external factors such as extracurricular activities as well as differing features of specific social media platforms.", "It follows that the risk problematic social media use poses for each individual adolescent may change over time.", "Thus, frequent social media use is not an addiction in and of itself, but changing circumstances may increase or decrease the risk of problematic use.", "This chapter has provided guidelines for uses of three categories of social media measures in research and intervention design keyed to understanding and supporting adolescent mental wellbeing in a tech-saturated world.", "However, regardless of the measure used, certain factors are important to interpreting studies of social media and adolescent mental wellbeing: the context of study findings and causal inferences afforded by study designs.", "Considering findings in context", "Examining studies of general adolescent groups may lead to assumptions that all adolescents are equally prone to mental wellbeing outcomes associated with certain social media use measures.", "However, a growing body of evidence supports that subgroups of adolescents show differing internet and social media use patterns and associations with mental wellbeing outcomes.", "For example, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals are more likely to report having online friends who are more supportive than in-person friends (Ybarra et al. 2015).", "Further, for transgender, nonbinary, and gender-diverse youth, but not cisgender youth, higher wellbeing and body image scores are associated with problematic internet use, possibly due to the importance of being perceived as the gender with which one identifies (Allen et al. 2021).", "Thus, features of identity, and likely other contextual factors, may be related to motivation and usage patterns behind social media use and associated mental wellbeing outcomes.", "Research and design should acknowledge that social media is not used in a vacuum, but occurs in the context of each adolescent’s unique identities and life circumstances.", "Carefully considering causality", "When examining associations between social media use measures and mental wellbeing outcomes, many may jump to the conclusion that social media causes mental health outcomes.s.", "However, it is important to recognize that most studies in this area have employed a cross-sectional approach, an observational study design in which data are collected at one time point.", "When using such approaches, clear conclusions about whether the time or manner of social media use represents a cause or effect of mental wellbeing outcomes cannot be made.", "While some social media uses may cause certain mental wellbeing outcomes, it is also possible that individuals with different mental wellbeing states use social media in unique ways.", "This interpretation would fit with a uses and gratifications framework (Blumler and Katz 1974), in that adolescents with different mental wellbeing states may be expected to have different individual reasons for using social media.", "Nevertheless, for most studies, causal directions remain unclear, and researchers should be cautious in interpreting relationships between social media use and mental wellbeing.", "Youth author perspective: Garv Bhasin", "As stated previously, few studies document causal relationships between social media use and wellbeing.", "One review has argued that for adolescents with depression symptoms, it is unclear whether the usage of social media causes or exacerbates depressive symptoms, or if depressive symptoms cause these individuals to seek out more social media use, creating a harmful cycle (Bozzola et al. 2022).", "Conversely, we are unsure if adolescents' positive mental wellbeing states are caused by social media habits such as active use or if positive mental wellbeing prompts them to use social media in this way.", "An observation I have made through my own interactions with social media and prior research is that negative mental wellbeing would lead to a relatively greater amount of passive social media use whereas positive mental wellbeing would result in more active use of social media.", "To elaborate, adolescent users who are in a worse mental state would tend to passively scroll through other social media accounts or watch others' content without engaging in the form of comments or posts.", "By contrast, adolescents who have better mental wellbeing would tend to post more about themselves or their lives on social media while also engaging relatively more with previously posted content in the form of likes or comments.", "It is important to note here that in both cases adolescent users are not engaging with social media in only one way or the other; rather, they are engaging in either active or passive use a relatively greater amount based on their current mental wellbeing status.", "Conclusions", "This chapter has described three distinct approaches for measuring adolescent social media use as well as guidelines for interpreting such measures.", "A critical conclusion is that not all uses and relationships around social media are the same, nor are associated mental wellbeing outcomes.", "Further, features of adolescents’ identities and experiences may influence their social media usage patterns and mental wellbeing outcomes.", "These conclusions have important implications for research and design approaches to supporting adolescent mental wellbeing in a tech-rich world.", "Strategies to maximize benefits and mitigate risks of social media use should not default to centering on screen time.", "Instead, multifaceted approaches targeting key features of social media use, particularly interactions and activities and problematic use, should be adopted.", "Further, approaches must avoid casting social media use as an uniform experience across adolescents that contributes identical influences on mental wellbeing.", "Instead, the individuality of adolescent social media users, their personal history, mental wellbeing, and motivations for interacting with technology should be acknowledged.", "A challenge of this approach is that millions of adolescents use social media, and a focus on the usage patterns of groups, rather than individuals, is essential.", "Thus, supporting adolescent mental wellbeing requires an ongoing quality improvement process in research and design.", "This approach should advocate for a continuous cycle of improvement of technologies and other resources to support adolescent mental wellbeing, assessment of their effectiveness, and refinement of these technologies and resources.", "Doing so will encourage the design of social media and supportive resources to progress ever closer to meeting the needs of all adolescents, while adapting to external circumstances that could change how adolescents use social media.", "References", "American Academy of

If ADHD could be cured with diet, everyone would be doing that. Eating healthily is as good for anyone as for people with ADHD.”", "Blame game", "Parents often feel guilty about how they feed their children, but cost and access make eating healthy, whole foods all the time almost impossible, hence the high volume of UPFs in the average child (and adult) diet in Britain.", "Wicks is a champion of cooking more and eating well, but it’s dangerous to suggest diet can cure neurological conditions or chronic disease.", "“There is no evidence to show that eating certain foods or not eating foods causes ADHD or other neurodiverse conditions and I think this is scaremongering to say so,” says specialist dietitian Priya Tew.", "“We do not want any parents or carers to feel guilt or shame, feeling they have caused their child’s condition.”", "Dr James Brown, chair of ADHD Adult UK, has said that in a meta-analysis of seven studies, no evidence was found of any link between sugar consumption and ADHD.", "Tew points out that a preference for plain and repetitive meals is common among those with neurodiversity.", "“Whilst many neurodiverse people can prefer processed foods, beige foods and safe foods, this does not mean that these foods are the cause of their symptoms,” she says.", "“But they could prevent children reaching all of their nutritional requirements which may contribute to symptoms. It is a good idea to try and expand the diet to make it as varied as possible. This can be very tricky to do, taking time and patience.”", "“What we eat and drink can most certainly impact on our mood and how we feel (in both a positive or negative way),” says dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine of Nic’s Nutrition, who thinks Wicks’ comments were taken out of context unfairly, and that he works hard to improve our nation’s health.", "“However, the links between diets high in UPFs and mental health are far from clear, and are difficult to unpick. This is because of the complex genetic, psychological and social factors that contribute to the development of mental health problems, in addition to the effects that poor mental health can have on food choices and dietary intake.”", "Diet and exercise – the impact", "“Regardless of ADHD, a balanced diet provides essential nutrients for overall mental and physical health,” says Dr Ivantu.", "“Healthy eating habits can improve energy levels, mood, and sleep, which can indirectly benefit individuals with ADHD and some other mental health conditions.”", "Tew recommends focusing on the Mediterranean diet, rich in whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats, including the omega 3s found in oily fish, and fruit and vegetables.", "“Reducing sugar and white carbohydrates is good for overall health and may help with some symptoms,” she says.", "“Whilst we need more research to fully support this I’d definitely recommend including two servings of oily rich fish a week or using a good quality fish oil supplement as omega-3’s are so good for overall health and brain health.”", "Read Next", "Consultant dietitian Ro Huntriss says that tracking what you or your child eats can help.", "“The NHS suggests that people with ADHD should eat a healthy, balanced diet and to not cut out foods before seeking medical advice,” she says.", "“It also says that some people may notice a link between types of food and worsening ADHD symptoms. If this is the case, keep a diary of what you eat and drink, and what behaviour follows.”", "Both Dr Ivantu and Sarah Templeton highlight exercise as a great way to manage ADHD symptoms.", "“We have some good data about the benefits of physical exercise in improving attention, executive functioning and motor skills,” says Dr Ivantu.", "“On the other hand physical exercise has limitations towards managing hyperactivity symptoms, or social problems which often come with someone suffering from ADHD. Something which I tell my patients diagnosed with ADHD is that physical exercise is a free and sustainable medication.”", "What now? Wick’s comments that many are “misdiagnosed” has simply opened a different line of attack.", "Now he’s being schooled for a different mistake – that diagnosis is easy, while most face a wait of years for NHS assessments with specialist psychiatrists.", "“Mental health is not a one-size-fits-all,” points out Dr Ivantu.", "“It’s highly important to consult an appropriately trained healthcare professional before making any decisions regarding your health. In my opinion, physical exercise, lifestyle changes, coaching, therapy, healthy nutrition and positive use of technology should be considered as part of a comprehensive ADHD treatment plan.”"], "provider": {"name": "inews.co.uk", "domain": "inews.co.uk"}, "publication_date": "2024-04-16T00:00:00+00:00", "label": 1}

physical comfort for those struggling — with embroidery reading “I feel weak, but I know I’m strong” on hoodies’ wrists.", "Students were encouraged to write positive affirmations on Post-it notes, which included phrases like “just be raw,” and “I am not defined by my past — I am driven by my future.”", "Jahi Ferguson, BSU’s vice president and a senior majoring in biology, described why the

Black accomplishments and achievements.", "In an Instagram post announcing their programming, BSU wrote, “we also use this month to highlight the stories of Black individuals across the diaspora as a way to acknowledge our linked heritage.”", "“BSU hopes the audience left Keynote 2024 with a sense of community that they may not have felt in Binghamton before,” Ferguson wrote.", "“Our mission is to promote Unity in Heritage and building community [in] every aspect of the word, hence our different yearly programming.

They won’t get arrested,” making clear the point of his joke was another shot at New York City’s lawsuit that he felt meant they somehow weren’t prioritizing prosecuting murderers.", "Panelist Julie Banderas added, “A lot of divorces would end a lot cleaner that way, too” as Gutfeld laughed and Tyrus said, “I agree. I just feel like you’ve got to be able to just prove— you just need one good reason for justifiable homicide.”", "Gutfeld made it clear at the beginning of the segment that he didn’t agree with the lawsuit.", "After he said the suit accused the companies of “manipulating kids to get them addicted,” Gutfeld added, “I don’t know what that means.”", "He then asked Banderas, “Is this exactly what NYC should be focusing on right now?”", "She answered, “This is so stupid. First of all, sue the stupid parents, that’s what you should be doing.”", "“Because parents don’t know how to parent!”", "Banderas added to audience applause.", "Feigning horror, Gutfeld retorted, “You want the government to sue the parents?”", "“I mean, sue somebody who should be taking responsibility for their stupid kids having too much screen time,” Banderas said, before going on to defend corporations.", "“Who’s responsible for that? The parents, the government, the city. The social media companies are not responsible. They’re there for free for children to use at their will. Children should not be making these decisions on their own. Parents should.”", "“My kids have tried to sue me multiple times,” Banderas continued.", "“But I will not pay for this lawyer, because I paid for enough attorneys … my kids, f–k ’em, they’ll go to therapy later in life.”", "Banderas is a mom of three kids, and her oldest was born in April 2010.", "Gutfeld then suggested to Kat Timpf that the city sue “the rapists and the murderers in New York City instead.”", "“No kidding,” she replied.", "“If you’re counting on New York state to … have the responsibility of your children’s mental health, god help you, right? But nobody is. This is cash grab.”", "“A lot of these companies, first of all, the last thing you should want to do is pissing them off because they have a lot of real estate here. They pay a lot of taxes here. I don’t know who New York expects to keep paying these taxes, because they’re pissing off everybody. They’re making it impossible to do business here,” Timpf continued.", "“And every single day, they’re like, ‘I have an idea’: Another cash grab that makes it an even less welcoming environment for businesses. Who’s going to pay for all this s–t? I’m so over it. The amount that I pay in taxes, you pay in taxes, you walk outside and you look around and you’re like, ‘It smells like piss.’ Where does all of my money go? Where does it go?”", "“It’s being pissed away!”", "Gutfeld yelled.", "“Your money’s being pissed away!”", "Watch the entire segment from “Gutfeld!” in the video above."], "provider": {"name": "thewrap.com", "domain": "thewrap.com"}, "publication_date": "2024-02-26T00:00:00+00:00", "label": 1}

Several studies have confirmed that limiting phone usage during class increases performance on both standardized test scores and end-of-course exams. The gains were equivalent to an additional hour of instructional time per week. Restricting phone use outside class time also shows benefits. For example, when schools place limitations on them during recess, researchers found that students exercise far more, burning off energy, fostering physical health, and promoting later attention in class.”", "House HHS Committee Hears Presentation on Mental Health:", "This week, the House Health and Human Services Committee heard a presentation from the Iowa Department of Health and Human

How does that influence how they navigate these apps?’ I think that’s a much more interesting question as a researcher, and it’s also much more important for parents and educators to consider.”", "Gentzler’s research revealed a subject’s personality — in particular the degree of extraversion — can determine how they experience social media.", "Findings indicated teens with higher levels of extraversion who use Instagram often may not experience depression, whereas those with low and average levels of extraversion may be at risk for greater depressive symptoms.", "Alderson focused on the role personality played in the study.", "“When we’re thinking about personality and social media, we’re thinking about how your general disposition influences how you navigate and interact with these platforms,” he explained, adding that social media platforms use predictive algorithms to match the content users see to their personality and interests.", "“If your teen is highly extroverted or has even average levels of extraversion, the social media content they see and how they interact with that content may differ relative to teens lower in extraversion,” Alderson continued.", "“I think that gets at some of the negative affective reactions to social media that we saw as well, particularly for an app like TikTok that’s tailored to them through an algorithm.”", "The researchers believe it’s important for teens to take note of how they feel on a social media platform.", "“Those cognitions you have while you’re navigating an app are important,” Alderson said.", "“A teen could take a step back and think, ‘What is it I’m consuming on this platform? And when I’m scrolling through, what am I thinking about? Do I feel better or worse after I’ve scrolled TikTok for 30 minutes?’ As the study talks about, there are different ways of interacting with social media platforms, which in turn may influence how you feel after using them.”", "This may be because extroverted teens are likely to have more friends who will like and interact with their posts, thereby making their experiences on Instagram more rewarding.", "Also, extroverted people tend to have more positive outlooks and may interpret negativity on social media in a more positive way.", "Gentzler said passively using social media rather than actively communicating directly with others has been found to be particularly problematic for teens’ mental health.", "While Instagram users often interact with friends, TikTok users usually watch videos from strangers.", "TikTok was also associated with higher depressive symptoms, but only for teens who said they were likely to have negative thoughts and feelings while using social media.", "For the teens who reported they were unlikely to have negative reactions to social media, TikTok was unrelated to depressive symptoms.", "“Social comparison is common for adolescents both in person and online,” she said.", "“Thus, it is possible that these teens who already said they’re prone to negative thoughts and feelings may be comparing themselves to people they see on TikTok and feeling badly about themselves as a result.”", "This study also suggested teens who were more often on YouTube reported higher levels of depressive symptoms, and the association did not vary based on gender, self-esteem or personality.", "The study included 237 participants, most from West Virginia, aged 14 to 16.", "Gentzler employed the help of students in the research.", "“Through the NIH funding, I was able to support graduate students with research stipends,” she said.", "“And regarding undergraduate students, there were probably 12 to 15 in the lab at a time, and they really had a lot of hands-on experience with this project.”", "In addition to creating surveys and planning, her undergraduate research assistants assisted with data collection while the study leads met with parents and teens.", "“They would pile in the cars with us at five in the morning to get to high schools because we were not just going to Monongalia County — we were all over,” Gentzler said.", "“Sometimes the undergraduates would present to entire homerooms, trying to get students interested in our study.
